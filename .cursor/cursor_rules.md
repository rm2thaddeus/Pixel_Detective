# Pixel Detective Project Rules

## MCP Integration & Sprint Planning

### MCP-Driven Development Workflow

1. **Sprint Planning Integration**:
   - Follow sprint planning workflow defined in `.cursor/rules/sprint-planning.mdc`
   - Use Context7 MCP for technology research during sprint planning
   - Use Mindmap MCP for visual requirement and architecture planning
   - Generate PRDs using the integrated workflow before starting development

2. **Technology Research Protocol**:
   - Always use Context7 MCP to research implementation patterns before coding
   - Document Context7 findings in `/docs/sprints/sprint-{number}/research/`
   - Reference Context7 documentation in code comments and PRD sections

3. **Visual Planning Requirements**:
   - Use Mindmap MCP for complex feature architecture before implementation
   - Create sprint overview and feature architecture mindmaps
   - Convert mindmaps to structured documentation in PRDs

4. **GitHub Integration Standards**:
   - All sprint work must reference PRD sections in commit messages
   - Use GitHub MCP for milestone and issue management during sprints
   - Follow conventional commit messages with sprint/PRD references

## UI Configuration Rules

### Dark Mode Configuration

1. **Use Streamlit's Built-in Dark Mode**: 
   - Always use Streamlit's default dark mode theme by setting `base = "dark"` in `.streamlit/config.toml`.
   - Avoid custom color overrides unless absolutely necessary.
   - If custom colors are needed, document them clearly in comments.

2. **Minimal Custom CSS**:
   - Keep the `.streamlit/custom.css` file minimal and focused only on essential styling.
   - Custom CSS should primarily focus on the sidebar and image display components.
   - Document any custom CSS with clear comments explaining its purpose.

3. **Theme Consistency**:
   - All UI components should respect the dark mode theme.
   - Text should be light-colored on dark backgrounds, with sufficient contrast.
   - Interactive elements should have hover states that are visible in dark mode.

### Extendable Sidebar for Images

1. **Sidebar Structure**:
   - The sidebar should be designed to be extendable to accommodate varying amounts of content.
   - Image containers in the sidebar should use the `.stImage` CSS class for consistent styling.
   - Always set `initial_sidebar_state="expanded"` in `st.set_page_config()`.

2. **Image Display**:
   - Images displayed in the sidebar should be responsive and properly sized.
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for images that fail to load.
   - Ensure images have proper alt text and metadata for accessibility.

3. **Sidebar Interactivity**:
   - Sidebar components should have clear interactive states (hover, focus, active).
   - Clickable elements should have appropriate cursor styling.
   - Expand/collapse states should be clearly indicated to users.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Sidebar Implementation**:
   - Keep the sidebar code in `ui/sidebar.py` to maintain separation of concerns.
   - The `render_sidebar()` function should return any configuration needed by the main interface.
   - Import the sidebar into the main interface rather than duplicating code.

2. **CSS Loading**:
   - Load CSS using the `load_custom_css()` function in `app.py`.
   - Ensure CSS is loaded after page configuration but before any UI components.
   - Handle file not found errors gracefully.

3. **UI Component Relationships**:
   - Maintain clear relationships between the sidebar and main content.
   - Use session state to pass information between components.
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components.

## Testing UI Changes

1. **Dark Mode Testing**:
   - Test all UI changes in dark mode to ensure proper visibility and contrast.
   - Check text readability against all background colors.
   - Verify that all interactive elements are clearly visible.

2. **Sidebar Testing**:
   - Test sidebar with both minimal and extensive content to ensure proper expansion.
   - Verify that the sidebar scrolls correctly when content exceeds the viewport.
   - Test image loading in the sidebar with various image sizes and formats.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test UI changes in multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
   - Address any browser-specific CSS issues with appropriate fallbacks.

4. **MCP-Driven Testing**:
   - Use Browser Tools MCP for automated audits after UI changes
   - Capture screenshots using Browser Tools MCP for visual regression testing
   - Run performance audits using Browser Tools MCP after significant changes

## Sprint Integration Guidelines

### When Starting New Features
1. Check if feature is part of current sprint PRD
2. Reference PRD section in feature branch names and commit messages
3. Follow Context7 implementation patterns documented in sprint research
4. Update PRD with implementation progress and any deviations

### Daily Development Workflow
1. Reference sprint planning rules from `.cursor/rules/sprint-planning.mdc`
2. Use MCP server guidelines from `.cursor/rules/use-mcp-servers.mdc`
3. Follow debugging protocols from `.cursor/rules/debugging.mdc`
4. Adhere to feature implementation standards from `.cursor/rules/feature-request.mdc`

### Sprint Documentation
- Update sprint PRD with completion status
- Document any architectural decisions using Mindmap MCP
- Archive sprint artifacts in `/docs/sprints/sprint-{number}/`
- Use GitHub MCP to update project milestones and close completed issues
