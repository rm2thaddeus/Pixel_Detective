# 🧹 Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the Vibe Coding repository to prepare it for portfolio presentation. The cleanup focused on removing outdated test files, deprecated code, and organizing the project structure for better maintainability.

## Actions Taken

### ❌ Removed (Outdated/Deprecated)
- `Library Test/` - Test images no longer needed
- `screenshots/` - Old browser automation screenshots  
- `test_images_to_ingest/` - Single test file
- `test-images/` - Empty directory
- `src/` - Duplicate frontend structure

### 🗃️ Archived to `/docs/archive/deprecated/`
- `logs/` - Historical development logs (moved to preserve history)
- `models/` - Legacy model management code (superseded by backend services)
- Various deprecated scripts and performance tests

### 🔧 Reorganized
- **`/scripts`** - Kept only essential utilities:
  - `mvp_app.py` - Core MVP application
  - `batch_processing_client.py` - Batch processing utility
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

- **`/tests`** - Kept core functionality tests:
  - `test_ingestion_service.py` - Service integration tests
  - `test_task_orchestrator.py` - Task management tests
  - `pytest.ini` - Test configuration

### ✅ Preserved (Active Components)
- `backend/` - FastAPI services (ML Inference & Ingestion Orchestration)
- `frontend/` - Next.js application
- `utils/` - Shared utilities actively used across the codebase
- `docs/` - Project documentation and sprint history
- `database/` - Database management components
- `browser-tools-mcp/` - Browser automation tools
- `cache/` - Application cache directory

## Current Project Structure
The repository now has a clean, professional structure suitable for portfolio presentation:

```
Vibe Coding/
├── backend/                    # FastAPI services
├── frontend/                   # Next.js application  
├── browser-tools-mcp/          # Browser automation
├── docs/                       # Documentation
├── database/                   # Database components
├── utils/                      # Shared utilities
├── scripts/                    # Essential scripts only
├── tests/                      # Core functionality tests
├── cache/                      # Runtime cache
├── docker-compose.yml          # Container orchestration
└── README.md                   # Project overview
```

## Benefits
1. **Professional Presentation** - Clean, organized structure
2. **Improved Maintainability** - Easier to navigate and understand
3. **Preserved History** - Important artifacts moved to archive, not deleted
4. **Portfolio Ready** - Showcases current architecture and capabilities

## Next Steps
- Update main README.md with current project overview
- Ensure all active components are well-documented
- Consider adding architecture diagrams for portfolio presentation
