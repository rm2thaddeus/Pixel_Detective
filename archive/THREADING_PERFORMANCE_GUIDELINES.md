# Threading & Performance Guidelines for Pixel Detective

## 0. Task Orchestrator Integration

- Route all background tasks through the `TaskOrchestrator` in `components/task_orchestrator.py`, avoiding direct `threading.Thread` instantiation.
- Use the orchestrator's API (`submit(name, fn, *args) -> bool`, `is_running(name) -> bool`) to enforce single-thread per job and manage task lifecycle.

This guide consolidates best practices to maintain clear background threading, avoid redundant heavy imports, and ensure thread safety in our Streamlit-based image search app.

## 1. Heavy Modules Import
- Centralize all heavy ML/Data library imports (e.g., `torch`, `transformers`, `PIL`, `pandas`) into a single background operation.
- **Cache imports** with `@st.cache_resource` where possible to enforce one-time loading across reruns.
- **Guard thread spawn** using a `heavy_import_started` flag in `LoadingProgress` to prevent duplicate import threads.

## 2. BackgroundLoader Pipeline
- Use a single instance of `BackgroundLoader` to manage the full processing pipeline (preparation, scanning, database build).
- **Preserve import state** across pipeline resets: carry over `heavy_modules_imported` and `heavy_import_started` flags when resetting `LoadingProgress`.
- **Inline preparation** (in pipeline) should only run if no import is in progress or already completed.

## 3. Thread Safety and Session State
- **Do NOT access** `st.session_state` from background threads. All background work should communicate via the thread-safe `LoadingProgress` object.
- **UI components** must check for readiness flags (e.g., `database_ready`, `models_loaded`) before calling session-based managers.

## 4. Caching of Managers
- Decorate model and database manager factories with `@st.cache_resource(show_spinner=False)` to ensure a single shared instance:
  - `get_cached_model_manager`
  - `get_cached_db_manager`

## 5. Component Development
- In any UI component or screen:
  1. Check `st.session_state.get('database_ready', False)` before invoking database operations.
  2. Wrap session access in thread-safe guards:
     ```python
     if not st.session_state.get('database_ready', False):
         st.info("Database not readyâ€”please wait.")
         return
     ```
  3. Avoid direct background thread launches in component code; delegate to `BackgroundLoader`.

## 6. Adding Future Background Tasks
1. **Define state flags** in `LoadingProgress` for new task phases (e.g., `feature_extraction_started`).
2. **Guard thread creation** with those flags in `start_background_preparation` or a similar entry.
3. **Update progress** under `self._lock` to ensure consistent UI updates.
4. **Signal completion** via progress object, trigger UI rerun only when safe.

## 7. Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Multiple calls to `start_background_preparation` can spawn parallel threads; always guard with flags.
- Inline calls to `prepare_heavy_modules` in the loading pipeline must respect in-progress state.
- Never rely on `heavy_modules_imported` alone to prevent re-import; use a distinct `heavy_import_started` flag.
