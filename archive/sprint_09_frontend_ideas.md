# Archived Front-End Concepts – Sprint 09

_This document captures the UI/UX patterns and helper utilities implemented during Sprints 07-09 in the **Streamlit** front-end so they can be reused or re-implemented in the forthcoming React/Vite UI._

## 1  Accessibility & UX Components

| Module | Key Ideas | Why Keep |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `frontend/components/accessibility.py` | • Global style injector for focus rings, skip-nav links.<br>• Utility functions to build accessible buttons, alerts, progress bars. | Provides WCAG-compliant patterns that can be translated into React Hooks or component library wrappers. |
| `frontend/components/skeleton_screens.py` | • Re-usable skeleton loaders (`render_folder_scan_skeleton`, `render_loading_skeleton` …). | Demonstrates progressive loading placeholders; can guide Skeleton component design in React. |
| `frontend/styles/animations.css` | • Collection of keyframe animations (fade-in, slide, bounce, wave, celebrate, etc.). | Ready-made animation primitives – port to CSS/Sass modules or Framer Motion. |
| `frontend/styles/components.css` | • Atomic utility classes for buttons, alerts, status indicators. | Serves as initial design token reference before adopting Tailwind or CSS-in-JS. |

## 2  Application State Flow

`frontend/core/app_state.py` implements a simple FSM (_FAST_UI → LOADING → ADVANCED_UI → ERROR_).  Although the upcoming React app will likely adopt React Router + Context, the same screen-flow concept can be mirrored.

## 3  Background Loader Pattern

`frontend/core/background_loader.py` encapsulates polling the ingestion job status and exposing a typed progress object.  This logic can inspire a React Query wrapper or SWR hook that polls the FastAPI endpoint.

## 4  Sidebar Collection Management

The Streamlit sidebar component (`frontend/components/sidebar/context_sidebar.py`) centralises collection selection, creation and cache clearing.  Migrating this UX to the new UI will retain user familiarity.

## 5  Latent Space Visualisation

`frontend/components/visualization/latent_space.py` shows how UMAP + DBSCAN clustering results are plotted interactively (originally via Plotly).  The algorithmic steps (UMAP → DBSCAN) are generic and can be ported to the new stack; the code also documents sensible default parameters.

### Preservation Strategy

1. **Code Freeze** – No further changes will be made to `frontend/` except critical bug fixes.
2. **Documentation** – This markdown file summarises what is worth carrying over.
3. **Migration Tickets** – For each retained idea create tasks in Sprint 10 backlog (e.g., `TASK-10-05 – Implement AccessibleButton React component`).
