## [2025-05-27] - SPRINT 05: ADVANCED UI & STARTUP OPTIMIZATION

### Added
- **Advanced UI Screen (`screens/advanced_ui_screen.py`)**: Implemented tab structure for "Sophisticated Search", "Duplicates", "Latent Space Explorer", and "AI Guessing Game".
- **Task Orchestration (`components/task_orchestrator.py`)**: Basic task orchestrator for submitting background tasks and checking their status.
- **Optimized Model Manager (`core/optimized_model_manager.py`)**: Advanced model manager with background, prioritized loading and preloading capabilities for CLIP and BLIP models.
- **Fast UI Screen (`screens/fast_ui_screen.py`)**: Enhanced to initiate asynchronous preloading of models via `OptimizedModelManager` for faster advanced UI readiness.

### Changed
- **`components/search/search_tabs.py`**:
    - `render_duplicates_tab`: Refactored to use `TaskOrchestrator` for running duplicate detection (vector similarity search) in the background.
    - `render_guessing_game_tab`: Refactored to use `TaskOrchestrator` for running AI image understanding in the background.
- **`components/visualization/latent_space.py`**:
    - `render_latent_space_tab`: Refactored to use `TaskOrchestrator` for running UMAP and DBSCAN computations in the background. UI elements for parameter adjustment moved to sidebar.
- **`core/background_loader.py`**:
    - Updated to use `OptimizedModelManager` (via `core.optimized_model_manager.get_optimized_model_manager()`) instead of `LazyModelManager`. This aligns background processing with the preloading initiated by the Fast UI screen.
- **`models/lazy_model_manager.py`**:
    - Corrected `NameError` for `BLIP_MODEL_NAME` and `BLIP_PROCESSOR_NAME` by adding imports from `config.py`.
    - Corrected `BlipProcessor.from_pretrained` call to use `BLIP_PROCESSOR_NAME`.

### Fixed
- **BLIP Model Loading Error**: Resolved `NameError: name 'BLIP_MODEL_NAME' is not defined` in `models/lazy_model_manager.py` by adding missing imports from `config.py` and correcting processor name usage. This fixed the database build failure reported in `pixel_detective_20250527_203554.log`.

### Performance
- **Startup Optimization**: Streamlined model loading by introducing `OptimizedModelManager` with background preloading initiated from the `FAST_UI` screen. `BackgroundLoader` now leverages this preloading, aiming to meet the PRD goal of <1s `FAST_UI` render and faster overall readiness of the `ADVANCED_UI`.
- **Advanced UI Responsiveness**: Improved responsiveness of Duplicates, Latent Space, and AI Guessing Game tabs by offloading their long-running computations to background tasks using `TaskOrchestrator`.

### Adherence to Sprint Plan
- Implemented `FAST_UI`, `LOADING`, and `ADVANCED_UI` screens as per `PRD.md` and `technical-implementation-plan.md`.
- Addressed the BLIP model loading bug.
- Focused on startup optimization by refactoring model loading and leveraging background processing.
- Integrated `TaskOrchestrator` for specified Advanced UI tabs.

- Early duplicate detection: Added `scripts/find_duplicates.py` CLI tool and `utils/duplicate_detector.py` for pre-pipeline duplicate and near-duplicate detection using SHA-256 and perceptual hashing (phash), with EXIF extraction and CSV/console reporting.
- Content-addressable embedding cache: Added `utils/embedding_cache.py` (SQLite-based) and integrated cache checks into CLI MVP (`scripts/mvp_app.py`) to prevent redundant embedding computation.
- Background job offloading: Integrated `concurrent.futures` for parallel BLIP captioning in CLI MVP and Streamlit pipelines, improving responsiveness and throughput.
- **Hybrid Search Implementation**: Complete rewrite of search functionality using Qdrant's Query API
  - **Core Architecture**: Implemented proper RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) for combining vector and metadata search results
  - **Comprehensive Metadata Support**: Extract and index 80+ metadata fields from EXIF/XMP data:
    - Camera settings (aperture, ISO, focal length, shutter speed, exposure program, white balance, flash settings)

    - Temporal data (dates taken, modified, digitized with automatic year extraction)
    - Technical details (color temperature, contrast, saturation, lens info, camera serial numbers)
    - Content classification (tags, keywords, subject, caption integration)
  - **Advanced Query Parser** (`utils/query_parser.py`):
    - Generic key:value parsing for any metadata field (e.g., `camera:canon`, `iso:100`, `aperture:2.8`)
    - Field aliases mapping for user-friendly queries (`aperture_value` → `aperture`, `Keywords` → `keywords`)
    - Case-insensitive matching for all string comparisons with automatic normalization
    - Smart text extraction that separates semantic queries from metadata constraints
  - **Intelligent Search Logic**: 
    - SHOULD-based filter logic instead of restrictive MUST constraints for better recall
    - Soft constraint filtering that boosts relevance rather than blocking results
    - Progressive enhancement where vector search provides baseline, metadata refines ranking
    - Users always see results even when metadata filters don't perfectly match
  - **Data Migration & Population**:
    - Created `scripts/upload_to_qdrant.py` for migrating existing embeddings and metadata to Qdrant
    - Supports batch uploading with data validation, cleaning, and integrity checks
    - Maintains data consistency between embeddings and metadata records
  - **Query Examples Supported**:
    - Natural language: `"happy family photos"`, `"sunset landscape"`
    - Technical specs: `"iso:100 aperture:2.8"`, `"camera:canon lens:50mm"`
    - Combined queries: `"strasbourg 2023 family"`, `"sunset photos taken with Canon"`
    - Flexible matching: Partial matches still return relevant results
