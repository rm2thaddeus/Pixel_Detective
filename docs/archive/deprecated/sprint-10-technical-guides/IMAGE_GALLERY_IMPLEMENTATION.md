# Image Gallery Implementation - Sprint 10

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the image gallery functionality for the search interface, which has been refactored into a modular, component-based architecture for improved maintainability and performance.

## Problem Statement
The search functionality was returning results but images were not displaying properly:
- Images appeared as blank files with only filename descriptions
- No way to view full image metadata
- Missing thumbnail generation and serving endpoints
- Poor user experience for browsing search results

## Solution Architecture

### Backend Enhancements
The backend provides a robust set of endpoints to support the gallery:
-   `GET /api/v1/images/{image_id}/image`: Serves the full, original image file.
-   `GET /api/v1/images/{image_id}/thumbnail`: Serves an optimized 200x200 JPEG thumbnail.
-   `GET /api/v1/images/{image_id}/info`: Returns detailed image metadata, including EXIF data.

### Frontend Implementation (Refactored)

The monolithic `SearchPage` has been decomposed into a container component that orchestrates several single-responsibility child components.

#### 1. `hooks/useSearch.ts`
-   This custom hook now encapsulates all search-related logic.
-   It uses `@tanstack/react-query`'s `useMutation` to handle both text and image search, managing loading, error, and data states automatically.

#### 2. `components/SearchInput.tsx`
-   **Responsibility:** Manages all user input for search.
-   **Features:**
    -   Handles text input and drag-and-drop for image searches.
    -   Displays a preview of the selected image.
    -   Provides clear visual feedback for the current search type (text vs. image).

#### 3. `components/SearchResultsGrid.tsx`
-   **Responsibility:** Displays the grid of search results.
-   **Features:**
    -   Renders image thumbnails using the optimized `next/image` component.
    -   Shows a loading spinner during searches.
    -   Displays an informative "No results found" message.
    -   Handles user clicks on images to trigger the details view.

#### 4. `components/ImageDetailsModal.tsx`
-   **Responsibility:** Displays detailed information for a selected image in a modal dialog.
-   **Features:**
    -   Fetches detailed image data using `useQuery`, ensuring it only requests data when the modal is open for a specific image.
    -   Shows a full-size preview of the image.
    -   Presents all metadata (filename, dimensions, EXIF data) in a clean, readable format.
    -   Includes a "Download" button.

#### 5. `app/search/page.tsx`
-   This file now acts as a lean **container component**.
-   It uses the `useSearch` hook to manage the state.
-   It renders the `SearchInput`, `SearchResultsGrid`, and `ImageDetailsModal` components, passing down the necessary props and state.

## Data Flow (Refactored)

The data flow is now orchestrated by hooks and components:
1.  **User interacts** with `SearchInput`.
2.  `SearchInput` calls a handler function from `useSearch`.
3.  `useSearch` triggers its `useMutation` hook to call the backend API.
4.  `isLoading` state from the hook is passed to `SearchResultsGrid` to show a spinner.
5.  When the search completes, the `results` are passed to `SearchResultsGrid` for rendering.
6.  User clicks an image in the grid, opening `ImageDetailsModal`.
7.  `ImageDetailsModal` uses its `useQuery` hook to fetch and display the full details for that specific image.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Image Loading Strategy

1. **Primary Display**: Thumbnails for grid view performance
2. **Fallback Chain**: 
   - Thumbnail → Full Image → Placeholder
3. **Modal Display**: Full image with proper aspect ratio
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with informative placeholders

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Thumbnail Caching**: 1-hour browser cache headers
2. **Lazy Loading**: Images load as needed in grid
3. **Aspect Ratio**: Prevents layout shift during loading
4. **Base64 Thumbnails**: Stored in Qdrant for fast access
5. **Error Boundaries**: Prevent single image failures from breaking UI

## API Endpoints

### Image Serving
- `GET /api/v1/images/{id}/thumbnail` - 200x200 JPEG thumbnail
- `GET /api/v1/images/{id}/image` - Full original image
- `GET /api/v1/images/{id}/info` - Metadata without image data

### Search Integration
- `POST /api/v1/search/text` - Text-based image search
- `POST /api/v1/embed` - Image embedding for similarity search

## User Experience Features

### Search Results Grid
- **Responsive Layout**: 1-4 columns based on screen size
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback for interactive elements
- **Match Scores**: Percentage-based similarity indicators
- **Quick Preview**: Thumbnail-based browsing

### Image Details Modal
- **Full Image Display**: High-quality viewing experience
- **Metadata Tables**: Organized information presentation
- **EXIF Support**: Camera and technical details when available
- **Download Option**: Direct access to original files

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Multiple image source attempts
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for errors
- **Visual Placeholders**: Informative error states

4. **CDN Integration**: Distributed image serving

## Conclusion

The refactored image gallery is now a prime example of our new frontend architecture. It is more performant, easier to maintain, and separates concerns effectively between state management and UI rendering. This modular approach provides a solid foundation for future enhancements to the search experience.
