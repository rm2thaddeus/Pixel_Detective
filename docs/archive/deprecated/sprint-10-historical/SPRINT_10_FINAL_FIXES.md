# Sprint 10 - Final Fixes & Feature Completion

> **Status:** âœ… **COMPLETE**
> **Focus:** Address final user feedback to achieve 100% sprint completion.

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the final set of changes implemented to complete Sprint 10. The focus was on resolving two critical pieces of user feedback: improving collection management and fixing the broken image ingestion workflow.

Both features are now fully implemented and tested.

## 2. Collection Management: Deletion Enabled

**Problem:** Users could create and select collections, but had no way to delete them from the UI.

**Solution:**
A complete, end-to-end deletion workflow has been implemented.

### 2.1. Backend (`routers/collections.py`)
-   A new `DELETE /api/v1/collections/{collection_name}` endpoint was added to the FastAPI application.
-   This endpoint securely deletes the specified collection from the Qdrant database.
-   If the deleted collection was the currently active one, the application state is safely cleared.

### 2.2. Frontend (`components/Sidebar.tsx`)
-   A "delete" icon (`FiTrash2`) now appears next to each collection on hover.
-   Clicking the icon opens a confirmation dialog (`AlertDialog`) to prevent accidental deletion.
-   Upon confirmation, a `DELETE` request is sent to the new backend endpoint.
-   The UI uses `@tanstack/react-query`'s `useMutation` to handle the API call, automatically refreshing the collection list and showing a success/error toast notification.

**Result:** Users have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update Selection, Delete) capabilities for their collections directly within the UI.

## 3. Image Ingestion: File Upload Workflow

**Problem:** The previous "Add Images" modal asked for a local directory path, which is fundamentally incompatible with browser security models. The workflow was non-functional.

**Solution:**
The entire workflow has been redesigned to use a standard, secure file upload pattern.

### 3.1. Backend (`routers/ingest.py`)
-   A new `POST /api/v1/ingest/upload` endpoint was created to handle `multipart/form-data` uploads.
-   This endpoint receives a list of files from the frontend.
-   It saves these files to a **secure, temporary directory on the server**.
-   It then triggers the existing `process_directory` background task, pointing it to this new temporary directory.
-   A cleanup task is scheduled to automatically delete the temporary directory after the ingestion job is complete.

### 3.2. Frontend (`components/AddImagesModal.tsx`)
-   The text input for a file path has been completely removed.
-   It is replaced by a user-friendly "dropzone" area that, when clicked, opens the user's file explorer.
-   The input uses the `webkitdirectory` attribute, prompting the user to **select a folder**.
-   When a folder is selected, the browser provides a `FileList` of its contents to the application.
-   The frontend then sends these files to the new `/upload` endpoint.
-   The user sees the number of selected files and a loading indicator during the upload. Upon success, they are automatically redirected to the job logs page.

**Result:** The image ingestion workflow is now intuitive, secure, and fully functional. It delivers the user's desired experience (selecting a folder) while adhering to web standards.

## 4. Conclusion

These final fixes address the last remaining blockers for Sprint 10. The application is now in a stable, feature-complete state that aligns with the initial project goals.
