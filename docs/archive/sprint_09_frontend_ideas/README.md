# Frontend UI/UX Patterns Archive (Sprint 09)

This directory contains reusable UI/UX patterns, components, and styles that have been archived from the original Streamlit-based `frontend` directory. These assets were preserved during the Sprint 09 cleanup as per the task `R-10-02` in the PRD.

The goal is to provide a reference for future frontend development, ensuring that valuable ideas and implementations for accessibility, loading states, and general styling are not lost.
