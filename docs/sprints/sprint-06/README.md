# Sprint 06 Summary: Modular Service Architecture for Image Ingestion

## Sprint Goal & Achievements
Sprint 06 aimed to address performance bottlenecks and architectural limitations by modularizing the application's data ingestion pipeline into a set of interconnected services. This sprint successfully transitioned the core batch image processing workflow (embeddings, captions, metadata extraction, and database storage) from a monolithic script-based approach to a service-oriented architecture.

**Key Achievements:**

1.  **ML Inference Service (FastAPI):**
    *   Successfully created a FastAPI application (`backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/main.py`).
    *   Loads CLIP and BLIP models on startup.
    *   Exposes `/embed` and `/caption` HTTP endpoints for generating image embeddings and captions respectively.
    *   Exposes a `/batch_embed_and_caption` HTTP endpoint for efficiently processing multiple images in one request.
    *   Runs as a local Python process (Dockerization deferred).

2.  **Database Service (Qdrant):**
    *   Utilizes the official Qdrant Docker container.
    *   Configured with persistent storage via `docker-compose.yml` (`./qdrant_storage`).
    *   Accessible on `localhost:6333`.

3.  **Ingestion Orchestration Service (FastAPI):**
    *   Successfully created a FastAPI application (`backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py`).
    *   Exposes an `/ingest_directory` HTTP endpoint to process a directory of images.
    *   **Implemented an in-memory cache using image content hashes (SHA256) to avoid re-processing identical images**, significantly speeding up subsequent runs on the same dataset by skipping calls to the ML Inference Service for cached images.
    *   **Implemented batching of cache misses**: For images not found in the cache, they are collected into batches and sent to the ML Inference Service's `/batch_embed_and_caption` endpoint, reducing HTTP overhead.
    *   Orchestrates calls to the ML Inference Service for embeddings and captions (for non-cached images).
    *   Extracts detailed image metadata using `utils.metadata_extractor.py`.
    *   Stores image data (UUID, vector, caption, metadata) in the Qdrant Database Service.
    *   Filters for common image file types, skipping non-image files.
    *   Runs as a local Python process (Dockerization deferred).

4.  **Client Script:**
    *   `scripts/batch_processing_client.py` successfully interacts with the Ingestion Orchestration Service to trigger and monitor the ingestion process for a specified directory.

5.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   The complete pipeline (Client -> Ingestion Service -> ML Service -> Qdrant), including caching behavior, was successfully tested, ingesting a sample library of images.

## Current Architecture (Sprint 06)

*   **Qdrant Database Service:** Runs in Docker, managed by `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Command: `docker-compose up -d qdrant_db`
*   **ML Inference Service:** Runs locally as a Python FastAPI application.
    *   Location: `backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/main.py`
    *   Command: `python backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/main.py`
    *   Listens on: `http://localhost:8001`
    *   Key Endpoints: `/embed`, `/caption`, `/batch_embed_and_caption`
*   **Ingestion Orchestration Service:** Runs locally as a Python FastAPI application (includes in-memory image hash cache).
    *   Location: `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py`
    *   Command: `python backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py`
    *   Listens on: `http://localhost:8002`
*   **Batch Ingestion Client:**
    *   Location: `scripts/batch_processing_client.py`
    *   Command: `python scripts/batch_processing_client.py "/path/to/your/image_library"`

## How to Run the System (Current Setup)

1.  **Start Qdrant:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d qdrant_db
    ```
2.  **Start ML Inference Service:** Open a new terminal:
    ```bash
    python backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/main.py
    ```
    Wait for models to load and Uvicorn to start on port 8001.
3.  **Start Ingestion Orchestration Service:** Open another new terminal:
    ```bash
    python backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py
    ```
    Wait for Uvicorn to start on port 8002 and confirm connection to Qdrant.
4.  **Run Batch Ingestion Client:** Open a third terminal:
    ```bash
    python scripts/batch_processing_client.py "/path/to/your/image_library"
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/image_library` with the actual path to your images. The first run will populate the cache in the Ingestion Service. Subsequent runs with the same image data will be faster due to cache hits.

## Performance Considerations & Future Work

*   **Current Performance & Implemented Optimizations:** 
    *   The service-oriented approach introduces network latency and data serialization overhead compared to a monolithic script for *initial* processing of individual images.
    *   The **implemented in-memory image hash cache** in the `Ingestion Orchestration Service` significantly improves performance for *subsequent* processing of the same images by avoiding redundant calls to the `ML Inference Service`.
    *   **Batch Processing:** The `Ingestion Orchestration Service` now sends batches of images (cache misses) to the `ML Inference Service's /batch_embed_and_caption` endpoint. This significantly reduces the number of HTTP requests and improves throughput for uncached images compared to one-by-one processing.
*   **Planned Optimizations (Future Sprints):**
    *   **Persistent Cache:** The current image hash cache is in-memory and will be lost if the Ingestion Service restarts. Consider making this cache persistent (e.g., using a lightweight disk-based key-value store or a simple database like SQLite) for robustness across service restarts.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing in Ingestion Service:** While `httpx.AsyncClient` is used, further review of the ingestion loop for optimal non-blocking behavior during I/O and ML calls.
*   **Other `mvp_app.py` Features:** Functionality from `mvp_app.py` not yet migrated to the service architecture (client-side text search, detailed file-based reporting, incremental indexing/watch mode) will be addressed in future sprints.
*   **Dockerization of FastAPI Services:** The FastAPI services will be Dockerized in a future sprint for easier deployment and scaling.

## Special Mention

A special thanks to the AI pair programmer (Gemini) for its significant contributions to debugging, implementing caching and batching logic, and iterative refinement of the FastAPI services throughout this sprint. This collaborative effort was instrumental in achieving the sprint's challenging refactoring goals.

## Transition to Sprint 07

While Sprint 06 successfully established the new service-oriented backend for batch ingestion, several areas will carry over or become the focus of Sprint 07 and beyond:

*   **Continued Deprecation (Phase 3):** The "Phase 3: Deprecation and Cleanup" outlined in `SPRINT_06_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` will continue. This involves methodically refactoring or removing old modules from `core/`, `models/`, and `database/` as their functionalities are fully superseded and their users (e.g., remaining features in `scripts/mvp_app.py`, Streamlit UI components) are updated to interact with the new FastAPI services.
*   **Persistent Caching:** Implementing a persistent cache for the Ingestion Orchestration Service to retain benefits across restarts.
*   **UI Integration:** Adapting the Streamlit UI to fetch data and trigger actions via the new backend services.
*   **Dockerization of FastAPI Services:** Containerizing the `ml_inference_fastapi_app` and `ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app` for improved deployment and scalability.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Developing more extensive unit and integration tests for the new services.
