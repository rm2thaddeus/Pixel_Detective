# Transition from Sprint 06 to Sprint 07

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (End of Sprint 06 / Start of Sprint 07)

## 1. Sprint 06 Summary & Key Outcomes

Sprint 06 focused on a major architectural refactor, moving from a monolithic application to a service-oriented architecture for the data ingestion pipeline. The primary goal was to lay a foundation for improved scalability, maintainability, and performance.

**Key Achievements (as detailed in `docs/sprints/sprint-06/README.md`):
**
*   **ML Inference Service:** A FastAPI service (`backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/main.py`) was created to handle CLIP and BLIP model loading and expose `/embed`, `/caption`, and `/batch_embed_and_caption` endpoints. It currently runs as a local Python process.
*   **Database Service:** The official Qdrant Docker container is used for the database, with persistent storage configured (`./qdrant_storage`) and accessible on `localhost:6333`.
*   **Ingestion Orchestration Service:** A FastAPI service (`backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py`) was created to manage the ingestion workflow. It:
    *   Exposes an `/ingest_directory` endpoint.
    *   Implements an in-memory image hash cache (SHA256) to avoid re-processing.
    *   Batches cache misses for efficient processing by the ML Inference Service.
    *   Orchestrates calls to the ML and Database services.
    *   Extracts metadata and stores data in Qdrant.
    *   It currently runs as a local Python process.
*   **Client Script:** `scripts/batch_processing_client.py` was updated to interact with the new Ingestion Orchestration Service.
*   **End-to-End Testing:** The full pipeline (Client -> Ingestion -> ML -> Qdrant), including caching, was successfully tested.

**Overall Status:** The core backend services for batch ingestion are functional but not yet Dockerized (except Qdrant). An in-memory cache provides performance benefits for repeated runs.

## 2. Learnings from Sprint 06

*   The service-oriented architecture is viable and addresses key limitations of the monolithic approach.
*   In-memory caching is effective but not robust across service restarts.
*   FastAPI services (`ml_inference_fastapi_app`, `ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`) require Dockerization for consistent deployment and easier management as part of a complete system.
*   The Streamlit UI is currently disconnected from this new backend.
*   Significant legacy code still needs to be deprecated or refactored.

## 3. Items Carried Over to Sprint 07 / Focus for Sprint 07

Based on the `docs/sprints/sprint-06/README.md` ("Transition to Sprint 07" section) and the newly created `docs/sprints/sprint-07/PRD.md`, the following are key focus areas for Sprint 07:

*   **Dockerization of FastAPI Services:**
    *   Create Dockerfiles for `ml_inference_fastapi_app` and `ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`.
    *   Update `docker-compose.yml` to manage all three services (Qdrant, ML Inference, Ingestion Orchestration).
*   **Persistent Caching:**
    *   Implement a persistent cache (e.g., SQLite, disk-based key-value store) for the Ingestion Orchestration Service to replace the current in-memory cache.
*   **Streamlit UI Integration (Phase 1 - Read Operations):**
    *   Develop API endpoints in the backend services to serve data required by the UI.
    *   Modify the Streamlit UI to fetch and display data from these new API endpoints (focus on read operations first).
*   **Continued Legacy Code Deprecation:**
    *   Continue working through Phase 3 of the `SPRINT_06_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, systematically removing or refactoring outdated modules from `core/`, `models/`, etc.
*   **Testing and Stability:**
    *   Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the new services and their interactions within the Dockerized environment.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Document the Dockerization setup, persistent cache mechanism, new UI APIs, and update overall architecture diagrams.

## 4. Preparation for Main Branch Merge

A key goal for Sprint 07 is to stabilize the new service-oriented architecture, ensure robust testing, and complete necessary documentation to prepare the current work for a potential merge into the main branch.

## 5. Blockers & Dependencies

*   (Identify any known blockers or dependencies for Sprint 07 tasks, e.g., decisions on specific persistent cache technology, availability of personnel for UI work, etc.)
