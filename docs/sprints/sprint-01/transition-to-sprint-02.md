## 🎯 **CURRENT SPRINT: UI Integration & Polish**

### **Status**: Performance complete, UI components need updating for new architecture

### **Critical UI Issues Identified** ⚠️ *Priority: HIGH*

#### **Issue 1: Folder Selection Broken** 🔴 *Priority: CRITICAL*
**Problem**: "📂 Browse Folder" button doesn't open file explorer  
**Expected**: Should open native file browser like image search functionality  
**Current**: Button shows info message instead of opening folder dialog  
**Location**: `screens/fast_ui_screen.py` line ~45

**Solution Needed**:
```python
# Current (broken):
if st.button("📂 Browse Folder"):
    st.info("💡 **Tip:** Type or paste your folder path above")

# Target (working):
if st.button("📂 Browse Folder"):
    # Open native file browser and populate folder_path
    selected_folder = st.file_uploader("Select folder", type=None, accept_multiple_files=False)
    # Or use alternative folder selection method
```

#### **Issue 2: Background Loading Delay** 🔴 *Priority: HIGH*
**Problem**: System waits for user input before starting background imports  
**Expected**: Background module loading should start immediately after fast UI loads  
**Current**: Heavy modules only load when user clicks "Start Processing"  
**Impact**: User has to wait longer than necessary for full functionality

**Solution Needed**:
```python
# In fast_ui_screen.py or app.py:
def start_background_import_immediately():
    """Start importing heavy modules in background as soon as UI loads"""
    # Don't wait for user action - start background loading immediately
    # Show subtle progress indicator that system is preparing
    # Allow user to interact while background loading continues
```

#### **Issue 3: UI Component Integration** 🟡 *Priority: MEDIUM*
**Problem**: Original `ui/` components may not work with new `core/` and `screens/` architecture  
**Status**: Needs testing and potential updates  
**Components to verify**:
- `ui/main_interface.py` - May conflict with new screen routing
- `ui/sidebar.py` - Needs integration with new state management
- `ui/tabs.py` - Must work with 3-screen flow
- `ui/latent_space.py` - Requires new model loading patterns

## 🚀 **After UI Fixes: MVP Script Consolidation**

Once UI issues are resolved, the next major milestone is consolidating the lightning-fast Streamlit app with the efficient MVP script patterns:

### **Consolidation Goals**
1. **Unified Model Management** - Single LazyModelManager for both UI and CLI
2. **Shared Database Operations** - Common QdrantDB patterns
3. **Hybrid Processing** - Combine UI responsiveness with CLI efficiency
4. **Performance Optimization** - Best of both architectures

### **Expected Benefits**
- **Consistent Performance** - Same optimizations across both interfaces
- **Shared Caching** - Unified embedding and result caching
- **Maintenance Efficiency** - Single codebase for core functionality
- **Feature Parity** - All CLI optimizations available in UI
