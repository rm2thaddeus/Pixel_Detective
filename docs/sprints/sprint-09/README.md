# Sprint 09 README

## 1. Sprint Overview and Status

**Status:** âœ…&nbsp;Completed

**Theme:** Backend Validation, GPU Optimization & Streamlit Removal

**Primary Goals:**
- **Validated Backend Ingestion**: Fully tested and validated the entire backend ingestion pipeline for all critical image formats, including `.jpg`, `.png`, and RAW `.dng` files.
- **GPU-Optimized ML Service**: Refactored the ML Inference service for significant performance gains (~89% improvement on benchmarks) by implementing dynamic batch sizing, mixed-precision inference, and offloading DNG decoding. See the [Backend Architecture](/backend/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
- **Integrated Persistent Vector Storage**: Successfully ingested images, metadata, embeddings, and captions into Qdrant, enabling persistent collections and robust vector search.
- **Deprecated Streamlit Frontend**: Completely removed the legacy Streamlit UI and its dependencies, preparing the repository for the new Next.js frontend. Reusable UI/UX patterns were archived in `docs/archive/sprint_09_frontend_ideas`.

## 2. Key Deliverables

-   **Updated Qdrant Integration**: The backend now supports persistent, selectable Qdrant collections.
-   **High-Performance ML Inference**: The ML service is now significantly faster and more memory-efficient.
-   **Cleaned Codebase**: The `frontend` directory and all Streamlit dependencies have been removed.
-   **Comprehensive Backend Documentation**: Created detailed architecture and roadmap documents in the `/backend` directory.
-   **Updated Sprint 09 PRD**: The [PRD.md](./PRD.md) has been updated to reflect all completed work.
