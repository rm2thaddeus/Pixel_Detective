# Sprint 09 README

## 1. Sprint Overview and Status

**Status:** Planned

**Theme:** Recovery, Robustness, and Feature Enhancement

**Primary Goals:**
-   **Full Application Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing of all existing application functionalities.
-   **Persistent Qdrant Collections:**
    -   Implement loading of Qdrant collections at application startup.
    -   Develop a mechanism to check if a collection has already been created.
    -   If a collection does not exist, prompt the user to specify a folder to build/load the collection from (e.g., via a button or text input).
-   **Frontend-Backend Alignment:**
    -   Reassess and update how each frontend screen behaves based on current backend API capabilities.
    -   Integrate new backend APIs to display logs, progress indicators, and other relevant information in the frontend.
-   **Restore Critical Functionality:** Ensure the "Folder Load" feature is fully operational and robust.
-   **API Stability:** Solidify the API-driven architecture, ensuring all UI interactions are seamlessly handled via API calls.
-   **Error Handling & Test Coverage:** Improve error handling mechanisms across the application and expand test coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
