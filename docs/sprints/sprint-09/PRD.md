| ID        | User Story                                                                                                | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Status    | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| FR-09-01  | As a user, I want the application to use persistent Qdrant collections so that data is available across sessions. | - On startup, the application checks for an existing Qdrant collection.
- If a collection exists, it is loaded and made available for use.
- Qdrant data (vectors, metadata) persists between application restarts.                                                                | Planned   | High     |
| FR-09-02  | As a user, if no Qdrant collection exists, I want to be prompted to create one from a specified folder.      | - If no collection is found at startup, the UI presents an option (e.g., button, text input area) to specify a local folder path.
- User can trigger collection creation/ingestion from the specified folder.
- Progress of collection creation is displayed to the user.        | Planned   | High     |
| FR-09-03  | As a developer/user, I want improved frontend feedback for backend processes.                               | - Frontend screens utilize new/existing APIs to display progress for long-running operations (e.g., folder ingestion, search, duplicate detection).
- Relevant logs or status messages from the backend are displayed in the UI where appropriate.
- Clear error messages are shown for API failures. | Planned   | High     |
| FR-09-04  | As a user, I want the "Folder Load" functionality to be fully restored and reliable.                        | - User can initiate folder loading/ingestion from the UI.
- The process successfully calls the backend ingestion orchestration service.
- The frontend correctly recognizes common image formats, including RAW types like .dng.
- Images and metadata from the folder are correctly added to the Qdrant collection.
- UI provides feedback on success, failure, and progress.          | In Progress | High     |
| FR-09-05  | As a user, I want all application screens to behave consistently and reliably based on backend data.        | - All frontend screens correctly fetch and display data from the backend APIs (`service_api.py`).
- Critical crashes on the Fast UI screen (e.g., `AttributeError`) have been resolved.
- UI interactions (filtering, sorting, searching, etc.) accurately reflect backend state and capabilities.
- Stale or incorrect data presentation is minimized.            | In Progress   | Medium   |
| FR-09-06  | As a user, if the application crashes or encounters a critical error, I want to see a user-friendly error screen with recovery options. | - Critical frontend errors are caught gracefully.
- An error screen (`error_screen.py`) is displayed instead of a blank page or a Streamlit traceback.
- The screen shows the error message and offers options to "Try Again" or "Restart". | Done | High     |
| NFR-09-01 | The application must undergo full functional testing to ensure all features work as expected.             | - A comprehensive test plan covering all user stories from Sprint 08 and 09 is executed.
- All critical user flows are tested end-to-end.
- Identified bugs are documented and prioritized for fixing.                                                                           | Planned   | High     |
| NFR-09-02 | Qdrant collection loading at startup should be efficient.                                                   | - Time to check and load an existing Qdrant collection (e.g., 100k items) is within acceptable limits (e.g., <5 seconds).
- Application remains responsive during the initial check/load.                                               | Planned   | Medium   |
| NFR-09-03 | The frontend codebase must use a consistent and robust import strategy to prevent startup failures.        | - All local imports within the `frontend` module use absolute paths from the project root (e.g., `from frontend.core...`).
- The application starts reliably without `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError` issues. | Done | High     |

## 4. Technical Architecture
-   **Qdrant Integration:**
    -   Implement logic to initialize and connect to Qdrant at application startup (`app.py` or a core module).
    -   Modify backend services (`ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`, `ml_inference_fastapi_app`) to work with pre-configured/persistent Qdrant collection names instead of creating them on-the-fly for every operation, unless a new collection is explicitly being built.
    -   The `config.py` might need updating to store the default collection name or path for persistence.
    -   **Note:** _Qdrant collections can become corrupted, especially during development or abrupt shutdowns. For production, implement a failsafe mechanism: regular backups, health checks, and automated restore._
-   **Frontend (`app.py`, `screens/`, `components/`):
    -   **Logging & Stability:** A centralized, configurable logger has been implemented in `utils/logger.py` and integrated across all core frontend modules. A strict absolute import strategy (e.g., `from frontend.core...`) has been enforced to resolve critical startup errors.
    -   **Error Handling:** A new `screens/error_screen.py` module provides a user-friendly interface for critical frontend exceptions, offering recovery options.
    -   Develop UI elements for prompting folder input if a collection doesn't exist.
    -   Integrate API calls for progress/log updates (potentially new endpoints or modifications to existing ones in `service_api.py` and backend FastAPI apps).
    -   Review and refactor screen logic (e.g., in `screens/`) to align with API-driven data fetching and state management, ensuring they use `service_api.py` for all backend communications.
-   **Backend API (`ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`, `service_api.py`):
    -   The ingestion service might need an endpoint to check collection existence or create a collection if it doesn't exist, based on a user-provided path.
    -   APIs should provide more granular progress/status updates for long-running tasks if not already present.

## 5. Implementation Timeline
| Week   | Milestones                                                                                                                               |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Week 1 | Implement Qdrant persistence: startup check, load existing, or prompt for new collection. Backend API updates for collection management. |
| Week 2 | Restore and test "Folder Load" functionality with new persistence logic. Begin frontend integration for progress/logs.                     |
| Week 3 | Complete frontend updates for all screens (API alignment, progress/log display). Conduct comprehensive functional testing.                 |
| Week 4 | Bug fixing, performance optimization (especially collection loading), finalize documentation, E2E testing.                               |

## 6. Testing Strategy
-   **Unit Tests:** For new Qdrant interaction logic, API endpoint changes, and `service_api.py` updates.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Verify Qdrant persistence across application restarts.
    -   Test the full flow of collection creation from a user-specified folder.
    -   Ensure frontend interactions correctly trigger backend processes and reflect their state (including progress/logs).
    -   Validate the restored "Folder Load" functionality end-to-end.
    -   Verify that critical frontend errors trigger the user-friendly error screen and that recovery options work as expected.
-   **E2E Tests (Playwright):** Update existing tests and add new ones to cover all critical user flows with the new persistence and UI feedback mechanisms.
-   **Manual Testing:** Comprehensive exploratory testing of all application features.
-   **Performance Testing:** Specifically for Qdrant collection loading times and overall application responsiveness during startup and intensive operations.

## 7. Risk Assessment
| Risk                                            | Mitigation Plan                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complexity in Qdrant persistence logic          | Allocate dedicated time for research and prototyping in Week 1. Refer to Qdrant documentation and examples. Start with a basic file-based persistence for Qdrant if needed. |
| UI updates for progress/logs become extensive   | Prioritize critical feedback paths first. Use existing UI patterns where possible. Phase implementation if necessary.                                                      |
| Difficulties in testing persisted state         | Develop clear setup/teardown procedures for tests involving persistent data. Use dedicated test collections.                                                               |
| "Folder Load" restoration uncovers deeper issues | Allocate buffer time for debugging. Use the `debugging.mdc` guidelines systematically. Involve backend and frontend expertise collaboratively. **(Risk Realized & Mitigated: This risk occurred, leading to significant debugging of the application's startup sequence, import structure, and logging. The issues have been resolved, unblocking development.)**                            |
| Performance issues with collection loading      | Profile loading times early. Investigate Qdrant optimization settings. Consider lazy loading or background loading for parts of the data if initial load is too slow.         |
| **Qdrant collection/data corruption**           | **Implement regular automated backups, health checks, and an automated restore/failsafe mechanism for production. For development, manual reset is acceptable, but for scale-up, a robust recovery plan is required.** |
