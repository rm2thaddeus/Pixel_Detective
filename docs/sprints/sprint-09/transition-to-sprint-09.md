# ðŸš€ Transition to Sprint 09: Project Plan

## 1. Sprint Theme & Goals
**Theme:**  
> **Recovery and Robustness:** Restore all core user flows (especially "folder load"), ensure API-driven architecture is stable, and improve error handling and test coverage.

**Primary Goals:**
- Restore and robustly test all critical features broken or degraded by the recent refactor.
- Ensure seamless UI â†’ API â†’ backend roundtrip for all user actions.
- Add/restore user feedback for errors and edge cases.
- Strengthen integration and end-to-end testing.

---

## 2. Backlog Refinement

### High Priority
- **TASK-09-01:** Restore "Folder Load" functionality (UI â†’ API â†’ backend).
  - Diagnose and fix the broken flow.
  - Ensure user feedback for errors.
  - Add integration tests for this flow.
- **TASK-09-02:** Expand integration tests for all major user flows (search, duplicate detection, random image, filtering).
- **TASK-09-03:** Ensure all API endpoints are covered by unit and integration tests.
- **TASK-09-04:** Add robust error handling and user feedback for all critical UI actions.

### Medium Priority
- **TASK-09-05:** Performance benchmarking of key endpoints and flows.
- **TASK-09-06:** UI polish and bug fixes identified during Sprint 08/09 testing.

### Low Priority
- **TASK-09-07:** Documentation updates (API docs, architecture diagrams, changelogs).
- **TASK-09-08:** Cleanup of legacy modules and code.

## 3. Key Action Items

- **A. Diagnose and Fix "Folder Load"**
  - Trace the UI action to the backend.
  - Ensure the API endpoint exists and is reachable.
  - Add error handling and user feedback.
  - Write integration tests for this flow.

- **B. Test All Major Flows**
  - Manual and automated (integration/E2E) testing for:
    - Search
    - Duplicate detection
    - Random image
    - Filtering

- **C. Error Handling**
  - Ensure all user actions provide clear feedback on failure.
  - Log errors for debugging.

- **D. Documentation**
  - Update `/docs/sprints/sprint-09/transition-to-sprint-09.md` (or similar).
  - Update `/docs/CHANGELOG.md` with major changes and fixes.

## 4. Sprint Rituals & Standards

- **Daily Standups:** Focus on blockers for recovery tasks.
- **Code Reviews:** Emphasize test coverage and error handling.
- **Demo/Review:** Show restored flows and improved robustness.
