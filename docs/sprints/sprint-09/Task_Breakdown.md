# Sprint 09 Task Breakdown

**Overall Sprint Goal:** Restore all core user flows (especially "Folder Load"), ensure API-driven architecture is stable, and improve error handling and test coverage, with a specific focus on providing real-time progress and log updates from the backend to the frontend sidebar.

---

## I. Completed Tasks (Frontend Foundation for Logging Integration)

This section details the foundational work done on the frontend to prepare for receiving and displaying backend logs and progress for ingestion tasks.

1.  **`frontend/core/background_loader.py` Refinements:**
    *   **Status:** Modified and user-accepted.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Ensured `job_id` received from `service_api.ingest_directory` is correctly stored in `st.session_state[LOADING_JOB_ID_KEY]`.
        *   The loader now fetches job status/details via `service_api.get_ingestion_status(job_id)`.
        *   **Adapted to backend API change:** It now expects logs in an array `api_response.get("logs")` and joins them into a newline-separated string for `st.session_state[LOADING_DETAIL_KEY]`. Falls back to `message` or `details` fields if `logs` is not present.

2.  **`frontend/components/sidebar/context_sidebar.py` Major Refactor:**
    *   **Status:** Modified and user-accepted.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   `render_sidebar` function converted to `async def`.
        *   Now uses the global `background_loader` instance to initiate folder ingestion tasks.
        *   Displays dynamic status, progress percentage, and error messages derived from `background_loader.progress` properties.
        *   Includes an `st.expander("Show Details/Logs")` that will display the content of `background_loader.progress.current_detail` (intended to be the logs from the backend).
        *   Periodically calls `await background_loader.check_ingestion_status()` within its render cycle if a job is active, to refresh the status and logs.
        *   Temporarily removed the "Merge Folder" UI to focus on the primary ingestion log display, as `background_loader` currently handles one job at a time.

3.  **Adaptation of Calling Hierarchy for `async` Sidebar:**
    *   **Status:** Verified and user-accepted changes in relevant files.
    *   **`frontend/screens/advanced_ui_screen.py`:**
        *   The method `_render_contextual_sidebar` (which calls `render_sidebar`) was converted to `async def`.
        *   The call to `render_sidebar()` within it is now `await render_sidebar()`.
        *   The call to `AdvancedUIScreen._render_contextual_sidebar()` from `AdvancedUIScreen.render()` is now `await AdvancedUIScreen._render_contextual_sidebar()`.
        *   The necessary import `from frontend.components.sidebar.context_sidebar import render_sidebar` has been added.
    *   **`frontend/core/screen_renderer.py`:**
        *   The main `render_app` function (which is `ScreenRenderer.render`) is already `async`.
        *   `AdvancedUIScreen.render()` (which calls the sidebar) is correctly `await`ed within `render_app`.
    *   **`frontend/app.py`:**
        *   The main application entry point `main_async()` is already `async` and uses `asyncio.run()`, correctly handling the `async` rendering chain.

4.  **Core Application Stability & Foundational Debugging:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Goal:** Resolve critical application startup failures to unblock all frontend development and testing.
    *   **Details & Implementation Notes:**
        *   **Centralized Logging Utility:**
            *   Enhanced `utils/logger.py` to provide a standardized, configurable, and file-rotating logger for the entire application.
            *   Integrated this logger across all core frontend modules (`app_state.py`, `screen_renderer.py`, `service_api.py`, `background_loader.py`) to provide rich, contextual debug information. Log level is configurable via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
        *   **Resolved Module Import Strategy:**
            *   Systematically refactored all local imports within the `frontend` directory to use a consistent, absolute path from the project root (e.g., `from frontend.core...`).
            *   This resolved persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` and `ImportError` exceptions that were preventing the application from starting.
        *   **Implemented Graceful Error Handling UI:**
            *   Created the missing `frontend/screens/error_screen.py` module.
            *   Implemented `render_error_screen` to provide users with a clear error message and recovery options ("Try Again", "Restart") when a critical frontend exception occurs.
            *   Integrated this error screen into the main application flow in `screen_renderer.py`.

## II. Completed Bug Fixes (Post-Stability)

This section details bugs that were identified and fixed after the initial application stability was achieved, unblocking core functionality.

1.  **BUG-09-01: `AttributeError` Crash on Fast UI Screen**
    *   **Status:** Fixed.
    *   **Symptom:** The app loaded but immediately showed an `AttributeError: 'BackgroundLoader' object has no attribute 'start_background_preparation'` on the home screen.
    *   **Analysis:** The `FastUIScreen` was calling an obsolete method (`start_background_preparation`) left over from a previous architecture.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed the obsolete method and its call from `frontend/screens/fast_ui_screen.py`, resolving the crash.

2.  **BUG-09-02: DNG Image Files Not Recognized by Frontend**
    *   **Status:** Fixed.
    *   **Symptom:** When a user selected a folder for ingestion, any `.dng` files within it were ignored.
    *   **Analysis:** The frontend's file discovery logic contained a hardcoded list of image extensions that was missing the `.dng` format.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `.dng` to the set of recognized `image_extensions` in `frontend/screens/fast_ui_screen.py`, allowing them to be discovered and processed.

## III. Next Steps & Remaining Tasks

With the critical startup and UI bugs resolved, the next step is to **perform a full end-to-end test of the primary user flow: folder ingestion.** This involves:
1.  Launching the application.
2.  Selecting a folder containing a mix of images (including `.dng` files).
3.  Initiating the ingestion process.
4.  Monitoring the logs in the UI to ensure the process completes successfully.
5.  Verifying that the application transitions to the `Advanced UI` screen upon completion.

This will validate the recent stability fixes and confirm that the frontend and backend are communicating correctly.

### A. Backend API and Logging Enhancements (Ingestion Service)

> **Note:** Qdrant collections can become corrupted (e.g., due to abrupt shutdowns or disk issues). For development, manual reset is acceptable, but for production/scale-up, a failsafe mechanism should be implemented: regular automated backups, health checks, and automated restore/recovery scripts.

1.  **Task: Implement Real Job Management & Background Processing for Ingestion**
    *   **Status:** Substantially complete.
    *   **Goal:** `/api/v1/ingest/` endpoint should initiate folder ingestion as a non-blocking background task and return a `job_id`.
    *   **Details & Implementation Notes:**
        *   Modified `ingest_directory_v1` in `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py` to use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.
        *   Generates a unique `job_id` for each ingestion request.
        *   Initial job status (e.g., "pending", progress, initial log) is stored in the in-memory `job_status_db`.
        *   The core ingestion logic moved to `_run_ingestion_task` and scheduled in the background.
        *   The endpoint now immediately returns the `job_id` and initial status.

2.  **Task: Implement Persistent Job State Storage (Status, Progress, Logs)**
    *   **Status:** Partially complete (in-memory storage implemented).
    *   **Goal:** Store status, progress percentage, and detailed log messages for each ingestion job.
    *   **Details & Implementation Notes:**
        *   An in-memory dictionary `job_status_db` in `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py` is used for job state.
        *   The background ingestion task (`_run_ingestion_task`) updates this store with:
            *   Current status (e.g., "processing", "completed", "failed").
            *   Progress percentage.
            *   A list of log messages (strings) detailing its operations and any errors, using the `log_to_job` helper.
        *   *Consideration for future sprints: For production, replace in-memory storage with a more robust solution like Redis if service instances might be restarted or scaled.*

3.  **Task: Enhance Ingestion Task Logging**
    *   **Status:** Substantially complete.
    *   **Goal:** The ingestion background task should capture detailed operational logs.
    *   **Details & Implementation Notes:**
        *   The `_run_ingestion_task` and its helper `process_batch_with_ml_service` in `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py` now use the `log_to_job` helper.
        *   Log messages (timestamped and with level) are collected in `job_status_db[job_id]["logs"]`.

4.  **Task: Update `/ingest/status/{job_id}` Endpoint for Real Data**
    *   **Status:** Substantially complete.
    *   **Goal:** `/api/v1/ingest/status/{job_id}` endpoint should return actual status, progress, and detailed logs.
    *   **Details & Implementation Notes:**
        *   Modified `get_ingestion_status_v1` in `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/main.py` to retrieve job information from `job_status_db`.
        *   Populates the `JobStatusResponse` model, which now returns `logs: List[str]` containing the collected log messages. Other fields include `status`, `progress`, `result`, `directory_path`, and `total_files`.
        *   Handles cases where the `job_id` is not found (returns 404).

### B. Frontend Polish & Final Integration

1.  **Task: Adapt Frontend Log Display (If Necessary)**
    *   **Status:** Complete.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure logs from the backend are displayed clearly in the sidebar.
    *   **Details & Implementation Notes:**
        *   `frontend/core/background_loader.py` (in `
