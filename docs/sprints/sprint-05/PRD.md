# Sprint 05 PRD: UX Flow & UI Screens Implementation

**Sprint Duration:** 2025-05-28 to 2025-06-03  
**Sprint Lead:** TBD  
**Created:** 2025-05-27  
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-27

## Executive Summary

In Sprint 05, we will bring our UX_FLOW_DESIGN to life by building the three core screens (FAST_UI, LOADING, ADVANCED_UI), stabilize the captioning pipeline, and improve startup performance. This work ensures a seamless, non-blocking user journey from folder selection through full-featured search.

## Sprint Objectives
- FAST_UI: Instant app launch with folder picker, system status indicators, and background triggers
- LOADING: Interactive loading screen with live progress bar, logs, current phase, ETA, and pause/cancel controls
- ADVANCED_UI: Tabbed interface for Text/Image Search, AI Guessing Game, Latent Space Explorer, and Duplicate Detection
- Fix BLIP captioning: Resolve `BLIP_MODEL_NAME` undefined error to stabilize database build pipeline
- Startup Optimization: Defer heavy ML imports, inject skeleton screens, and reduce time-to-first-render

## Success Criteria
1. FAST_UI renders within 1s and correctly transitions to LOADING when a folder is selected
2. LOADING shows accurate progress, phase updates, and allows pause/cancel with no UI blocking
3. ADVANCED_UI tabs function end-to-end without direct thread calls, using TaskOrchestrator
4. Database build completes without BLIP errors, and BLIP captions appear correctly
5. Measured startup time reduced by â‰¥50% compared to Sprint 04 baseline
