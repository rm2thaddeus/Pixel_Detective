# Transition from Sprint 07 to Sprint 08

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Branch:** `development` (as of commit for Sprint 07 wrap-up)

## 1. Sprint 07 Summary & Achievements

Sprint 07 successfully focused on a major refactoring of the frontend to be asynchronous and on stabilizing the API communication layer between the frontend and the backend services.

**Key Achievements:**
*   **Frontend Asynchronous Refactor:**
    *   `frontend/core/service_api.py` was fully refactored to use `httpx.AsyncClient` for all API calls.
    *   `frontend/app.py`, `frontend/core/screen_renderer.py`, and individual screen modules (`fast_ui_screen.py`, `loading_screen.py`, `advanced_ui_screen.py`) were adapted to support asynchronous operations.
    *   `frontend/core/background_loader.py` was updated to work with the async `service_api.py`.
    *   `httpx` was added to `frontend/requirements.txt`.
*   **API Standardization & Connectivity:**
    *   Backend FastAPI services (ML Inference, Ingestion Orchestration) were standardized to use `/api/v1` prefixes for all relevant endpoints.
    *   Resolved HTTP 307 redirect issues (trailing slashes) and 500 errors (request body format mismatches) in ML service communication.
    *   The Ingestion Orchestration service now correctly calls the ML Inference service's `/api/v1/batch_embed_and_caption` endpoint.
*   **Successful API Layer Testing:**
    *   The `frontend/core/service_api.py` test script now passes, confirming successful:
        *   Embedding and captioning calls to the ML Inference service.
        *   Ingestion calls to the Ingestion Orchestration service (which includes a successful batch call to the ML service).
        *   Calls to placeholder search and image listing endpoints in the Ingestion Orchestration service.
*   **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Sprint 07 planning documents (`RECONNECT_UI_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, `TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`, `PRD.md`, `BACKLOG.md`) were updated to reflect progress, API changes, and remaining tasks.

## 2. Carry-over Tasks from Sprint 07

The following objectives from Sprint 07 were not fully completed and should be carried over to Sprint 08, as detailed in `docs/sprints/sprint-07/TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`:

*   **Objective 4: Continue Legacy Code Deprecation (`CLEAN-07-01`)**
    *   Review `docs/sprints/sprint-06/SPRINT_06_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` (Phase 3 tasks).
    *   Refactor/Delete `core/fast_startup_manager.py`.
    *   Refactor/Analyze `components/task_orchestrator.py`.
    *   Analyze and Refactor/Delete items from `utils/` (e.g., `utils/embedding_cache.py`).
    *   Review remaining features in `scripts/mvp_app.py` for service integration.
*   **Objective 5: Testing and Stability (`TEST-07-01`)**
    *   Write unit tests for FastAPI services.
    *   Write integration tests for service-to-service communication and Qdrant interaction.
    *   Develop/enhance end-to-end tests for the full ingestion pipeline.
*   **Objective 6: Broader Documentation (`DOC-07-01`)**
    *   Update `docs/sprints/sprint-06/README.md` (if needed).
    *   Create/Update `README.md` for `backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/`.
    *   Create/Update `README.md` for `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/`.
    *   Update the main `docker-compose.yml` with comments.
    *   Document new API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI or markdown).
    *   Update overall project architecture diagrams.
    *   Fill in Sprint 07 `README.md` (`docs/sprints/sprint-07/README.md`).

## 3. Sprint 08 Priorities from Backlog

Based on `docs/sprints/sprint-07/BACKLOG.md`, the following items are key priorities for Sprint 08:

*   **Backend Development:**
    *   **Full Qdrant Integration:** Implement actual Qdrant queries for search (`/api/v1/search/...`) and image listing (`/api/v1/images`) in the Ingestion Orchestration service, replacing current placeholders. This includes pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities.
    *   **New Endpoints:**
        *   Implement `Duplicate Detection Endpoint`.
        *   Implement `Random Image Endpoint`.
    *   **API Documentation:** Update/Generate OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all backend services.
*   **UI (Frontend):**
    *   **Full UI Validation:** Thoroughly test all Streamlit screens with the live async backend to ensure correct data display, state management, and smooth interactions.
    *   **Implement Features Using New Endpoints:**
        *   `Duplicate Detection Tab` in UI.
        *   `Random Image Selection` feature in UI.
        *   UI controls for `Advanced Filtering & Sorting` (once backend supports it).
    *   **Error Handling & UI Polish:** Improve user-facing error messages, refine the design system, accessibility, and responsiveness. Enhance loading/progress feedback.
*   **Testing & Stability (Beyond Carry-over):**
    *   Focus on achieving good test coverage for the new service interactions.
    *   Test error handling and edge cases in UI and backend.
*   **Documentation (Beyond Carry-over):**
    *   Document the `service_api.py` layer and its usage.
    *   Update/Create architecture diagrams.
    *   Create/Update user/developer guides.

## 4. Proposed Objectives for Sprint 08

1.  **Achieve Full Read-Path Functionality:** Complete Qdrant integration in backend services for robust image search and listing. Ensure UI correctly displays this data with proper filtering, sorting, and pagination.
2.  **Implement Key New Features:** Deliver UI and backend for Duplicate Detection and Random Image Selection.
3.  **Enhance System Robustness:** Make significant progress on unit/integration testing, improve error handling, and continue legacy code deprecation.
4.  **Improve Core Documentation:** Update service READMEs, API documentation, and architecture diagrams.

## 5. Action Items for Sprint 08 Setup

*   Create the sprint directory: `docs/sprints/sprint-08/`.
*   Initialize `docs/sprints/sprint-08/README.md` and `docs/sprints/sprint-08/PRD.md` (potentially using `docs/sprints/templates/PRD-template.md`).
*   Update `docs/sprints/planning/SPRINT_STATUS.md` to reflect Sprint 07 completion and Sprint 08 commencement.
*   Update `docs/sprints/planning/sprint-coordination.md` with any notes relevant to the S07->S08 transition.
*   Review and prioritize the full `docs/sprints/sprint-07/BACKLOG.md` and items listed here when formally planning Sprint 08.

This document serves as a handoff point. Sprint 07 is considered concluded with the achievements listed, and the remaining items are formally transitioned for Sprint 08 consideration.
