# Sprint 07 Progress Update (2025-05-30)

- FastAPI services (ingestion and ML inference) and Qdrant were started successfully.
- Resolved Python import issues in the Streamlit frontend by setting PYTHONPATH and clarifying import structure.
- Fixed a merge conflict in `frontend/screens/fast_ui_screen.py` by accepting incoming changes from the develop branch.
- Updated `frontend/app.py` to use the correct startup phase check instead of a missing attribute.
- The Streamlit app now boots and displays logs from the API in the UI debug section.
- Remaining issue: The ingestion pipeline fails to connect to the backend at `localhost:8000` (connection refused). This is likely due to the ingestion FastAPI service running on port 8002 instead of 8000, or a misconfiguration in the frontend's API endpoint settings.

# Sprint 07 Summary: Service Hardening, UI Integration, and Legacy Cleanup

## Sprint Goal & Achievements

Sprint 07 aims to:
1.  Dockerize the FastAPI services (ML Inference, Ingestion Orchestration).
2.  Implement a persistent cache for the Ingestion Orchestration Service.
3.  Begin integrating the Streamlit UI with the new backend services (starting with read operations).
4.  Continue the deprecation of legacy code.
5.  Ensure overall system stability and robust testing in preparation for a potential merge to the main branch.

## Performance Considerations & Future Work

*   For Sprint 08, add detailed time profiling to the ML Inference Service (especially BLIP captioning) to identify and optimize slow steps. This may allow significant improvements in BLIP captioning performance and overall batch throughput.

## Persistent Cache Solution (Sprint 07)

After researching persistent cache options for the ingestion service, **DiskCache** was selected:
- Pure Python, no external server required
- Fast, thread-safe, process-safe, and robust
- Supports local file storage and Docker volumes
- Simple API, easy to integrate as a drop-in replacement for in-memory cache

**Next steps:** Integrate DiskCache into the ingestion service and test with both local files and Docker volumes to ensure persistence and performance.

## Sprint 07 Wrap-up

Sprint 07 achieved a major architectural milestone:
- The Streamlit UI is now fully decoupled from backend logic and lives in the `frontend/` folder.
- All UI/backend communication is via HTTP API calls through the new `service_api.py` layer.
- FastAPI endpoints for image listing, search, and ingestion status are live; endpoints for duplicate detection, random image, and advanced filtering are planned.
- CORS is enabled for all FastAPI services.
- End-to-end integration is functional for all core features; further E2E and integration testing is planned.
- All major sprint documentation has been updated. See BACKLOG.md for remaining work and next steps.
