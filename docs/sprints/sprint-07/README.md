# Sprint 07 Summary: Service Hardening, UI Integration, and Legacy Cleanup

## Sprint Goal & Achievements

Sprint 07 aims to:
1.  Dockerize the FastAPI services (ML Inference, Ingestion Orchestration).
2.  Implement a persistent cache for the Ingestion Orchestration Service.
3.  Begin integrating the Streamlit UI with the new backend services (starting with read operations).
4.  Continue the deprecation of legacy code.
5.  Ensure overall system stability and robust testing in preparation for a potential merge to the main branch.

## Performance Considerations & Future Work

*   For Sprint 08, add detailed time profiling to the ML Inference Service (especially BLIP captioning) to identify and optimize slow steps. This may allow significant improvements in BLIP captioning performance and overall batch throughput.

## Persistent Cache Solution (Sprint 07)

After researching persistent cache options for the ingestion service, **DiskCache** was selected:
- Pure Python, no external server required
- Fast, thread-safe, process-safe, and robust
- Supports local file storage and Docker volumes
- Simple API, easy to integrate as a drop-in replacement for in-memory cache

**Next steps:** Integrate DiskCache into the ingestion service and test with both local files and Docker volumes to ensure persistence and performance.
