# Sprint 08 Task Breakdown

> **NOTE:** Significant trouble was encountered starting the backend FastAPI services due to Python relative import and circular import issues. See the new `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/README.md` and `backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/README.md` for correct startup instructions (e.g., `uvicorn backend.ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002` and `uvicorn backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`). This was a key pain point during sprint-08.

- [x] TASK-08-07-01: Refactor `frontend/components/sidebar/context_sidebar.py` to use `service_api.ingest_directory` for all folder processing/merging, removing direct `httpx` calls and local DB/model management.
- [x] TASK-08-07-02: Implement `get_all_vectors_for_latent_space()` in `frontend/core/service_api.py` to fetch data for visualization from a new backend endpoint.

- [x] TASK-08-07-04: Backend: Implement `GET /api/v1/vectors/all-for-visualization` endpoint in Ingestion Orchestration service to provide data for latent space explorer. (Confirmed done.)
- [x] TASK-08-07-05: Add batch embedding/captioning support to frontend via service_api.py.
- [x] TASK-08-07-06: Optimize requirements.txt for only used dependencies.

## Objective 8: Documentation & Cleanup (Renumbered)
All documentation and cleanup tasks have been deferred to the backlog for Sprint 09. See the backlog summary below.

## Task Status Update (Frontend Refactor)

- [x] Remove all legacy model loading and direct backend logic from frontend
- [x] Delete obsolete files: task_orchestrator.py, performance_optimizer.py, etc.
- [x] Ensure all UI is API-driven and stateless
- [x] Refactor sidebar, search, and visualization components to use only service_api.py for backend interaction
- [x] Remove all background task orchestration from frontend

See Sprint 08 README for detailed next steps on UI refactoring and polish.

### Objective 3: Decouple Frontend from Backend Logic (via `service_api.py`)
*   **Task 3.1:** Refactor `context_sidebar.py`
    *   Status: 🔄 In Progress (Significant refactoring done, but needs verification post ingestion bug fix)
    *   Details: Removed direct DB/model calls. All operations should now use `service_api.py`.
    *   Dependencies: `service_api.py` fully functional.
*   **Task 3.2:** Refactor `latent_space.py`
    *   Status: 🔄 In Progress (Major refactoring for `service_api.py` data loading and UMAP/DBSCAN on frontend. Older conflicting plot logic commented out to fix `IndentationError`.)
    *   Details: Data loading via `service_api.get_all_vectors_for_latent_space`. Client-side UMAP/DBSCAN implemented.
    *   Dependencies: Backend endpoint for `get_all_vectors_for_latent_space` must be stable.
*   **Task 3.3:** Refactor `search_tabs.py`
    *   Status: 🔄 In Progress (Major refactoring done to remove `LazySessionManager` and use `service_api.py` for search and AI guess)
    *   Details: Text search, image search, and AI guessing game now use API calls.
*   **Task 3.4:** Remove `LazySessionManager` and its direct usage.
    *   Status: ✅ Done (File removed, direct imports in `app_state.py`, `search_tabs.py`, `context_sidebar.py`, `latent_space.py` addressed. `AppStateManager` handles core state init.)
    *   Dependencies: All components updated to manage their own state or use `AppStateManager`.
*   **Task 3.5:** Remove direct `torch` / `clip` model loading from frontend components.
    *   Status: 🔄 In Progress (Removed from `config.py`. Grep search initiated to find other instances.)
    *   Dependencies: Backend services must handle all ML operations.
*   **Task 3.6:** Resolve Frontend Import and Startup Errors
    *   Status: ✅ Done (AppConfig import fixed, `latent_space.py` indentation error resolved, `LazySessionManager` import errors resolved).
    *   Details: App now starts, though runtime errors with backend calls exist.

### Objective 4: Performance Optimization
*   **Task 4.1:** Identify and address causes of slow initial load time.
    *   Status: 🟡 Pending (Blocked by critical ingestion call bug)
*   **Task 4.2:** Ensure UI remains responsive during backend API calls.
    *   Status: 🔄 In Progress (Async calls in place, further optimization may be needed)

### Objective 5: Bug Fixing and Stability
*   **Task 5.1:** Critical: Fix "Request error calling ingestion service".
    *   Status: ❗ NEW - BLOCKER (Under Investigation)
    *   Details: Frontend fails when trying to initiate ingestion process via `service_api.py`.
*   **Task 5.2:** Investigate and resolve `torch` runtime messages.
    *   Status: 🟡 NEW - In Progress
    *   Details: Logs show `torch` related errors, potentially from watcher or stray imports.
*   **Task 5.3:** Systematically test all UI features after refactoring.
    *   Status: 🟡 Pending (Blocked by critical bugs)

## Objective 7: Frontend Refactoring & Decoupling (New Objective from previous plan)
*   **Overall Status:** 🔄 In Progress
*   **Summary of Work Done:**
    *   Removed `LazySessionManager` and updated dependent components.
    *   Refactored `search_tabs.py`, `context_sidebar.py`, `latent_space.py` to use `service_api.py` for backend communication.
    *   Addressed critical startup errors related to imports (`AppConfig`, `LazySessionManager`) and component errors (`IndentationError` in `latent_space.py`).
    *   Removed direct `torch` dependency from `frontend/config.py`.
*   **Current Blockers:**
    *   Failure in calling the backend ingestion service.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Resolve ingestion service call failure.
    *   Eliminate any remaining frontend `torch` imports.
    *   Thoroughly test all refactored components and UI flows.
    *   Address application slowness.
