# Sprint 08: Qdrant Integration, Core Feature Delivery & Frontend Refactoring

**Status**: PLANNED  
**Start Date**: 2025-06-01  
**End Date**: 2025-06-28  

## 1. Objectives
1. Achieve full Qdrant integration in backend for search and image listing.
2. Implement Duplicate Detection and Random Image endpoints & UI features.
3. Enable Advanced Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination UI controls.
4. **Refactor key frontend components (`context_sidebar.py`, `latent_space.py`) to exclusively use `service_api.py` for backend communication, enhancing decoupling and UI responsiveness.**
5. Improve Error Handling and UI polish (skeleton screens, feedback, accessibility).
6. Strengthen Testing & Stability (unit, integration, E2E, performance benchmarks).
7. Continue Legacy Code Cleanup and Documentation.

## 2. Key Deliverables
- 📦 Backend services: `/api/v1/search`, `/api/v1/images`, `/api/v1/duplicates`, `/api/v1/random`, **and `/api/v1/vectors/all-for-visualization`**.
- 🖥️ Frontend:
    - Duplicate Detection Tab, Random Image Selector, Filtering/Sorting controls, skeleton/loading states.
    - **Refactored `context_sidebar.py` and `latent_space.py` for API-driven operations.**
- 🧪 Tests: Integration tests for all new endpoints, E2E pipelines, error-case tests, performance benchmarks
- 📚 Documentation: Service API docs, updated architecture diagrams, developer/user guides, CHANGELOG updates reflecting frontend refactoring.
- 🧹 Cleanup: Deprecate legacy modules, remove deprecated scripts, audit session state usage

## Sprint Goals:

1.  **Advanced UI Implementation (Continued):**
    *   ✅ Complete all core UI components for the Advanced UI screen.
    *   ✅ Implement robust data visualization for latent space (ensure it uses `service_api.py`).
    *   🔄 **Refactor UI for Decoupling:** Systematically remove direct model loading, database interactions, and `LazySessionManager` dependencies from UI components. All backend operations must go through `service_api.py`. (Partially Complete, Ongoing)
        *   AppConfig import issues resolved.
        *   `latent_space.py` indentation error fixed by commenting out older logic.
        *   Direct `torch` import removed from `frontend/config.py`.
        *   Removed `LazySessionManager` import from `app_state.py`.
2.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   🟡 **Initial Load Time:** Address initial slowness observed in the application. (Pending critical bug fix)
    *   🟡 **Component Responsiveness:** Ensure UI remains responsive during backend calls. (Partially Addressed by async calls, further improvements pending)
3.  **Bug Fixing & Stability:**
    *   🔄 **Critical: Ingestion Service Call Failure:** Frontend fails when calling the backend ingestion service. (Under Investigation - Blocker)
    *   🟡 **Investigate Torch Runtime Messages:** Address potential underlying issues with Torch environment or stray frontend imports. (Ongoing)
    *   ✅ Resolve startup crashes related to imports and component errors. (Largely Addressed)
4.  **Backend API Integration & Refinement:**
    *   ✅ Ensure `service_api.py` is the sole interface for frontend-backend communication.
    *   ✅ Implement `get_all_vectors_for_latent_space` endpoint in backend and integrate with frontend. (Assumed done based on previous work, verification pending full app functionality)

### Key Achievements:

*   Frontend application now starts without critical import or component initialization errors that previously prevented launch.
*   Resolved `AppConfig` import errors by correcting import paths.
*   Fixed an `IndentationError` in `latent_space.py` by commenting out older, potentially conflicting code.
*   Removed direct `torch` dependency from `frontend/config.py`.
*   Removed `LazySessionManager` import from `app_state.py`.
*   Frontend attempts to call backend ingestion service, signifying progress in decoupling (though the call itself is failing).

### Roadblocks & Challenges:

*   **Critical Blocker:** The application fails when the frontend attempts to call the backend ingestion service. This needs immediate investigation (requires full frontend error logs and backend service logs).
*   **Performance:** Initial application load time is reported as slow.
*   **Potential Torch Environment Issues:** Lingering `torch` runtime messages in logs need investigation to ensure a clean frontend environment.
*   **Completeness of Decoupling:** Need to systematically verify that all direct backend operations and legacy state management are removed from UI components.

### Next Steps:

*   **Diagnose and Fix Ingestion Service Call Failure:** This is the top priority.
*   **Investigate and Resolve Torch Runtime Errors:** Use grep search results to find and remove any unnecessary frontend torch imports.
*   **Address Application Slowness:** Profile and optimize once critical bugs are fixed.
*   **Complete Full Decoupling Refactor:** Continue verifying and refactoring components to use `service_api.py` exclusively.
*   Systematically test all UI interactions and backend calls.
