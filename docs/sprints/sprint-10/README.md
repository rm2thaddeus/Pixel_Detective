# Sprint 10 – Critical UI Refactor / Vertical-Slice v0.1 - ✅ COMPLETE

Welcome to **Sprint 10**! This sprint delivered the first production-ready slice of the new **Next.js + TypeScript** frontend that talks directly to our FastAPI backend services. The work included a significant and successful architectural refactor. This README is your single-page orientation guide.

---

## 1. Why This Sprint Exists
The Streamlit interface was removed in Sprint 09. Users currently need to hit the backend with cURL or the CLI. Our goal was to restore a **modern, real-time UI** that:
1. Exercises *every* critical backend endpoint.
2. Establishes reusable React patterns (routing, state, data-fetch, theming).
3. Provides a thin but valuable end-user experience (collection management, ingestion, search, live logs).
4. Is built on a scalable and maintainable component-based architecture.

---

## 2. High-Level Objectives - ✅ ALL ACHIEVED
| ID | Objective | Success Metric |
|----|-----------|---------------|
| O-1 | Home screen shows backend health & active collection | Banner turns green when `/` responds 200 OK |
| O-2 | Collection management UI | User can list, create, select, and delete collections via a dedicated page. |
| O-3 | Add-Images flow with live progress | Functional folder path upload → ingestion job → progress bar to 100 % |
| O-4 | Search MVP | Text prompt → grid of top-N images |
| O-5 | Architectural foundations in place | Next.js app boots, React-Query/Zustand/Chakra configured with best practices. |
| O-6 | CI smoke-test pipeline | GH Actions build + contract test passes |

---

## 3. Deliverables Checklist
- [x] `frontend/` Next.js project scaffold
- [x] **Home** page with health & collection summary
- [x] **Dedicated Collections Page** for full CRUD management.
- [x] **Refactored Search Page** with modular components (`SearchInput`, `SearchResultsGrid`, `ImageDetailsModal`)
- [x] **AddImagesModal** + Loading/Logs page
- [x] `lib/api.ts` (typed axios wrapper) & `store/` Zustand slices
- [x] `hooks/useSearch.ts` hook abstracting search logic with `react-query`.
- [x] Centralized Theming with `semanticTokens` in Chakra UI provider.
- [x] GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [x] Updated Documentation

## 5. Getting Started (TL;DR)
```bash
# 0. Prerequisite – backend services running on ports 8002 / 8001
# 1. Setup frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# 2. Open http://localhost:3000
```
Environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8002
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:8002  # placeholder for Sprint 11
```

## 6. Team & Roles
| Role | Name |
|------|-------|
| Frontend Lead | You (junior dev) – focus on UI & state |
| Backend Advisor | Senior dev / AI assistant |
| DevOps Support | TBD |

---

## 7. Where to Dive Deeper
1. **`PRD.md`** – formal requirements & acceptance criteria.
2. **`technical-implementation-plan.md`** – step-by-step tasks with file paths.
3. **`docs/sprints/critical-ui-refactor/*`** – original long-form blueprint.
4. **`backend/ARCHITECTURE.md`** – source of truth for API contracts.

Good luck – and remember to document every significant decision in the sprint folder!
