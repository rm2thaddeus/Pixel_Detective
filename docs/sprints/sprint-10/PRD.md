# Sprint 10 Extended – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Codename:** _Critical UI Refactor – Full Backend Integration v1.0_
> **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All Phase 1 & 2 goals achieved.
> **Prepared for:** Development Team  
> **Related Docs:** [`README.md`](./README.md)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Sprint 10 has been **completed successfully**. The sprint was extended to include a full backend integration and a critical frontend architectural refactor, both of which are now finished. The application has been transformed from a UI prototype into a fully functional, robust, and scalable system.

**Key Achievements:**
*   ✅ **Complete Frontend Refactor**: "God components" have been eliminated, `react-query` now manages all server state, and the theme is centralized.
*   ✅ **Full Backend API Integration**: All endpoints for collections, ingestion, and search are fully implemented and integrated.
*   ✅ **New Collection Management Hub**: A dedicated page for managing collections is now available.
*   ✅ **Dark Mode Implemented**: A complete theme system with a user-facing toggle is functional.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### 2.1 Sprint Goals – ✅ ACHIEVED
1. ✅ **Operational & Refactored UI**: A non-technical user can navigate all features, and the underlying architecture is now scalable and maintainable.
2. ✅ **Shared Frontend Architecture**: Established best practices for routing, state (`react-query`, Zustand), theming (semantic tokens), and data-fetching.
3. ✅ **Full Backend Integration**: All critical backend services are implemented and connected.
4. ✅ **Dark Mode Support**: Complete theme system with persistence.

### 2.2 Still Out of Scope (Future Sprints)
*   Latent Space visualisation, AI Guessing Game, Duplicate Detection UI
*   Desktop/Electron packaging & native folder picker
*   Advanced analytics and monitoring dashboards
*   Multi-user authentication and authorization

## 3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria - FINAL

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|----|------------|--------------------|---------|
| FR-10-01 | As a user I open the web app and instantly see if backend services are healthy | Banner shows ✅ when both services return 200. Error banner if not. | ✅ Complete |
| FR-10-02 | I can view, create, select, and delete collections | Full CRUD in the UI, API calls successful, state updates correctly. | ✅ Complete |
| FR-10-03 | I can ingest images from a local folder and watch progress | Folder upload functional, job tracking page shows real progress. | ✅ Complete |
| FR-10-04 | I can search my collection with a text prompt or image | Search UI is modular, uses `react-query`, returns real results. | ✅ Complete |
| FR-10-05 | I can toggle between light and dark mode | Theme toggle in header, preference persisted, all components support both modes | ✅ Complete |
| FR-10-06 | As a developer, the Search page is maintainable | The `SearchPage` is broken into smaller components (`SearchInput`, etc.) and logic is in a `useSearch` hook. | ✅ Complete |
| FR-10-07 | As a user, I can manage my collections in a dedicated space | A `/collections` page exists with full management capabilities. | ✅ Complete |


### Non-Functional Requirements - FINAL
| ID | Requirement | Target | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|--------|
| NFR-10-01 | App loads quickly | First Contentful Paint ≤ 1.5s | ✅ Excellent |
| NFR-10-02 | Dark mode toggle is instant | Theme switch ≤ 100ms | ✅ Complete |
| NFR-10-03 | Search response time | End-to-end search ≤ 300ms | ✅ Achieved |
| NFR-10-04 | Code quality & CI | ESLint passes, no "God components" | ✅ Achieved |
| NFR-10-05 | Accessibility | Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90 | ✅ Achieved |
