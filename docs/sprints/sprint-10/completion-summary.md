## 5. Critical Lessons Learned 📚

### 🔧 **Technical Lessons**
- **Chakra UI v3 + Next.js 15**: Required `structuredClone` polyfill for SSR compatibility
- **CORS Configuration**: Must be configured early in development cycle
- **API Design**: Frontend-first development exposes backend API design issues early
- **State Management**: Zustand provides excellent DX for complex state scenarios
- **Error Boundaries**: Critical for production-ready React applications
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing prevents runtime errors and improves DX significantly

### 🎨 **UI/UX Lessons**
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users expect immediate visual feedback for all actions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex workflows need guided, step-by-step interfaces
- **Error Recovery**: Error messages must be actionable, not just informative
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design is non-negotiable for modern applications
- **Loading States**: Every async operation needs proper loading indicators

### 🏗️ **Architecture Lessons**
- **Component Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance for React components
- **API Client Design**: Centralized API client with interceptors simplifies error handling
- **Route Organization**: Next.js App Router provides excellent developer experience
- **Build Optimization**: Next.js 15 build optimizations significantly improve performance
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload and TypeScript checking accelerate development

### 🚀 **Process Lessons**
- **Documentation**: Living documentation prevents knowledge loss during extended sprints
- **Incremental Development**: Working UI first enables better backend API design
- **User Feedback**: Early UI prototypes reveal usability issues before backend investment
- **Technical Debt**: Address compatibility issues immediately, don't defer
- **Testing Strategy**: Component testing more valuable than E2E for UI-heavy applications

## 6. Pain Points & Resolutions 🔥

### 🐛 **Major Issues Resolved**
| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Resolution | Prevention |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_config')` | Blocked development | Chakra UI v3 + Next.js 15 incompatibility | Created `structuredClone` polyfill | Test compatibility matrix early |
| Network Error on API calls | No backend communication | Missing CORS configuration | Added CORSMiddleware to FastAPI | Configure CORS in backend setup |
| Module resolution errors | Build failures | Package version mismatches | Downgraded to Chakra UI v2.8.2 | Lock compatible versions |
