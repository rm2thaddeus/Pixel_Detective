## Separation of Concerns (Backend vs Frontend)

- Backend (API + Neo4j)
  - Owns ingestion, schema, and query performance.
  - Short‚Äëterm tasks:
    - Add POST triggers for enhanced doc/git ingestion.
    - Switch `/graph/subgraph` to keyset pagination (cursor `{last_ts, last_commit}`).
    - Expose telemetry endpoint or extend `/health` with `{avg_query_time_ms, cache_hit_rate}`.
  - Contracts used by UI: `/graph/subgraph`, `/commits/buckets`, `/evolution/*`, `/sprints/*/subgraph`, `/search/fulltext`.

- Frontend (Next.js UI)
  - Owns progressive fetch, rendering, interaction, and workers.
  - Short‚Äëterm tasks:
    - Prefer `/graph/subgraph` across views; avoid `/nodes|/relations` for large graphs.
    - Progressive hydration with pagination; keep LoD reducers enabled.
    - Hook Timeline to commit buckets; Sprint Tree to `sprints/{number}/subgraph`.
    - Gate clustering/layout behind workers when N is large.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Immediate Standalone Deployment (COMPLETED)

### Step 1.1: Test Current Docker Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /c/Users/aitor/OneDrive/Escritorio/Vibe\ Coding

# Start only Dev Graph services
docker compose up -d neo4j dev_graph_api

# Verify services are running
docker compose ps

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/nodes/count
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/commits?limit=10
```

If you changed code under `developer_graph/`, rebuild the API image first:
```bash
docker compose build dev_graph_api && docker compose up -d dev_graph_api
```

**Expected Results**:
- Neo4j accessible at `http://localhost:7474`
- API accessible at `http://localhost:8080/docs`
- Commits endpoint returns recent commits
- Nodes endpoint returns graph data

### Step 1.2: Ingest Initial Data
```bash
# Ingest recent commits into Neo4j
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/recent?limit=100"

# Verify data ingestion
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/nodes/count"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/relations/count"
```

**Expected Results**:
- 100+ commits ingested
- 1000+ nodes created (commits, files, requirements)
- 2000+ relationships created (TOUCHED, IMPLEMENTS, etc.)

Optional: Run enhanced doc ingestion (adds sprints, documents, chunks, mentions)
```bash
# From the host
docker exec -it $(docker compose ps -q dev_graph_api) \
  python -m developer_graph.enhanced_ingest

# Verify new node/edge types
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/nodes?node_type=Document"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/nodes?node_type=Chunk"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/relations?rel_type=CONTAINS_DOC"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/relations?rel_type=CONTAINS_CHUNK"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/relations?rel_type=MENTIONS"
```

### Step 1.3: Test Frontend Integration
```bash
# Start main frontend (if not already running)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Access Dev Graph at http://localhost:3000/dev-graph
# Verify all tabs work: Timeline, Sprint, Analytics
# Test graph visualization and node interactions
```

**Expected Results**:
- Frontend loads without errors
- Timeline shows commit history
- Sprint view shows sprint data
- Graph visualization renders nodes and edges
- Node details drawer works

```

---

## üìã Phase 4: Enhanced Features (CRITICAL REFACTORING REQUIRED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL UPDATE (2025-09-03)**: Performance analysis has revealed severe issues requiring immediate refactoring. See [DEV_GRAPH_PHASE4_ADDENDUM.md](./DEV_GRAPH_PHASE4_ADDENDUM.md) for detailed findings and comprehensive refactoring plan.

This phase implements four major UX and data improvements, plus two platform capabilities. It incorporates feedback from recent testing: slow graph load, heavy/thick links, lower interactivity vs. main branch, underpowered timeline, sprint view needing a tree layout, and mock analytics.

**Key Issues Identified**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Graph rendering performance issues with coordinate calculation warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Timeline View renders endless commit lists instead of lightweight visualization  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced Timeline lacks proper graph complexification visualization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sprint View needs minimalistic UI redesign
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics tab contains mock data instead of real metrics

### 4.1 Graph Performance & Interactivity
- Objectives:
  - Sub-second initial paint for a 30-day window; smooth 45+ FPS interactions.
  - Restore interaction parity: click-to-center, neighborhood focus, quick filters.
- UI Work:
  - Progressive rendering and level-of-detail (hide labels/edges at low zoom, show on hover/zoom-in).
  - Edge reducer: default thickness 0.4‚Äì0.8px, reduced opacity, optional weight scaling toggle.
  - Focus mode: dim non-neighbors on hover/select; keyboard shortcut to expand 1-hop.
- Data/API Work:
  - `GET /graph/subgraph?from&to&types&limit&cursor` windowed subgraph endpoint with counts (switch to keyset pagination; cursor carries `{last_ts, last_commit}`).
  - `GET /commits/buckets?granularity=day|week` for timeline density and caching.
  - Optional Redis/LRU for subgraph/query results (TTL 5‚Äì15 min).
- Neo4j/Queries:
  - Add/verify indexes: `:Commit(timestamp)`, `:File(path)`, `:Requirement(id)`, `:Chunk(id)`.
  - Ensure relationship type filters and time predicates use indexes; paginate where needed.
- Acceptance:
  - <1.0s first paint 30-day window; >45 FPS pan/zoom; no layout jank.
  - Edge thickness toggle works; labels on hover/high zoom only.
- Reasoning:
  - Constraining graph size by time and deferring rendering of offscreen elements yields immediate responsiveness without losing detail when zooming in.

### 4.2 Timeline Redesign (Slider + Commit Dots + Subgraph Preview)
- Objectives:
  - Beautiful slider with commit dots and range brush; fast hover tooltips.
  - Show a subgraph preview of what changed for a commit or range.
- UI Work:
  - Slider with brush and zoom; clustered dots for dense zones; accessible tooltips.
  - Below slider: a compact Sigma view rendering the commit/range impact subgraph (k<=200 nodes), with quick filter chips.
- API Work:
  - `GET /commits?from&to&limit&cursor` for dots; `GET /commits/{sha}/impact` for single commit.
  - `GET /graph/range-impact?from&to&k=200` to aggregate changes over a range.
- Acceptance:
  - 5k dots render <300ms (bucketed); commit hover tooltip <100ms.
  - Subgraph preview renders <250ms after selecting a commit/range.
- Reasoning:
  - The slider anchors temporal navigation; the preview conveys ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù at a glance without loading the full graph.

### 4.3 Sprint View as Tree (Hierarchical Subgraph)
- Objectives:
  - Sprint view reads as a tree (Sprint‚ÜíDocs‚ÜíChunks‚ÜíRequirements) with optional intra-sprint references.
- UI/Layout Work:
  - Use a layered DAG (ELK/dagre) via a Web Worker; cache layout per sprint.
  - Collapse/expand levels; toggles for cross-sprint edges (off by default) as faint dashed lines.
- API Work:
  - `GET /graph/sprint/{sprintId}?intra_only=true` returns only nodes with sprint==id and their internal edges.
- Acceptance:
  - <500ms to render 1 sprint (‚âà20 docs/200 chunks) from cache; clear hierarchy; readable labels.
- Reasoning:
  - Hierarchical layout matches how sprint docs are authored, turning hairballs into explanations.

### 4.4 Analytics Tab (Replace Mocks with Live Data)
- Objectives:
  - Show meaningful activity, graph, traceability, and quality proxy metrics with refresh timestamps.
- Metrics & Queries:
  - Activity: commits/day, files changed per sprint, churn (adds/dels), contributors.
  - Graph: nodes/edges by type, top-degree, components; optional weekly centrality snapshot.
  - Traceability: requirements linked to commits, lead time (first mention ‚Üí last commit), gaps.
  - Quality proxies: churn hotspots, rename frequency, test/code ratio heuristic, doc coverage per sprint.
- Backend:
  - Materialize heavy metrics on ingest/nightly; cache results. Endpoints under `/analytics/*`.
- UI:
  - Replace mock charts with typed data; show ‚ÄúLast refreshed‚Äù and a manual refresh.
- Acceptance:
  - Zero mocks; charts load <500ms from cache; endpoints documented with sample payloads.
- Reasoning:
  - Precomputation ensures consistent, fast dashboards even on large repos.

### 4.5 Remote Repository Support (Optional in this phase)
- Add `entrypoint.sh` to clone `GIT_REMOTE_URL` on container start; support `GIT_BRANCH`.
- Persist repo volume; health check for repo availability.

### 4.6 Export/Import & Snapshots
- Graph export/import as JSON including metadata (schema version, generated-at, filters).
- Snapshot endpoints for reproducible demos and regression comparisons.

## Phase 4 Work Breakdown (Weeks 1‚Äì2)

Week 1
- Implement subgraph/time bucket endpoints and add/verify indexes.
- Integrate progressive rendering, LOD, edge reducer, and focus mode in UI.
- Build timeline slider with bucketed dots; wire commit list API.
- Add commit impact and range-impact endpoints; render subgraph preview.

Week 2
- Implement sprint tree API and DAG layout worker with cache.
- Replace analytics mocks with `/analytics/*` endpoints and charts.
- Add Redis/LRU caching for subgraph/analytics; add refresh timestamps.
- Instrument performance timings; hit acceptance thresholds and tune.

---

## Phase 4 API Additions (Draft)
- `GET /graph/subgraph?from&to&types&limit&cursor`
- `GET /commits/buckets?granularity=day|week`
- `GET /commits?from&to&limit&cursor`
- `GET /commits/{sha}/impact`
- `GET /graph/range-impact?from&to&k`
- `GET /graph/sprint/{sprintId}?intra_only`
- `GET /analytics/activity?from&to`
- `GET /analytics/graph-summary`
- `GET /analytics/traceability?from&to`
- `GET /analytics/quality-proxies?from&to`
- `POST /snapshots/export` and `POST /snapshots/import`

Notes:
- Document query parameters, response shapes, and caching behavior in OpenAPI.
- Ensure all new endpoints have pagination where applicable.

---

## Phase 4 Acceptance Criteria & Validation
- Performance: first paint <1.0s (30-day window), >45 FPS interactions.
- Timeline: <300ms render for 5k dots; <250ms preview render; informative tooltips.
- Sprint view: <500ms cached render; clear hierarchy with expand/collapse.
- Analytics: no mock values; endpoints return typed JSON; charts load <500ms from cache.
- DX: OpenAPI docs include examples; Postman/ThunderClient collection updated.
- UX: Edge thickness toggle; label-on-hover; focus mode; quick filters present.

---

## Reasoning & Trade-offs (for Review)
- Progressive queries and rendering vs. full graph load: prioritizes responsiveness and aligns with how users explore (time-bound windows).
- Precomputation for analytics: reduces runtime flexibility but guarantees consistent demos and snappy UX; schedule refresh jobs to balance freshness.
- Hierarchical sprint layout: sacrifices some cross-links by default for clarity; provide an overlay toggle for power users.
- Client-side FA2 vs. server-side layout: start with client worker for simplicity; revisit server-side if caching doesn‚Äôt meet SLAs.
