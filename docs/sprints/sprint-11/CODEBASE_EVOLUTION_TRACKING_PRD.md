# Codebase Evolution Tracking System - Final PRD

**Sprint 11 Final Deliverable**  
**Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETED** - Ready for Phase 2 Implementation  
**Last Updated**: August 2025

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

Transform the current developer graph from a static relationship mapper into a dynamic **codebase evolution tracking system** that tells the story of how ideas, features, and architectural decisions evolved over time. The system will integrate git history, track idea lifecycles, and provide insights into what worked vs. what didn't.

**Core Vision**: A living, breathing knowledge atlas for our codebase that serves as both a temporal narrative and structural map, enabling developers to understand not just what the codebase is, but how it got there and what we can learn from that journey.

---

## 🚀 **Current Implementation Status**

### **✅ Phase 1: Temporal Foundation - COMPLETED**
- **Git History Service**: Full commit parsing, blame, rename detection
- **Temporal Schema**: Neo4j constraints for GitCommit/File nodes
- **API Endpoints**: 5 new endpoints for temporal data access
- **Sprint Mapping**: Maps sprint windows to git commit ranges
- **Temporal Engine**: Ingests commits/files into Neo4j
- **Frontend Timeline**: Basic commit feed; commit-limit slider (not a time scrubber yet)
- **Tests**: 100% pass rate on GitHistoryService validation

### **🔧 Phase 2: Evolution Tracking & UI - READY TO START**
- **Requirement & Implementation Tracking**: Link requirements to commits and files
- **Temporal Engine Enhancement**: Build evolution timeline for any node
- **Interactive Graph**: Enhanced filtering and timeline synchronization
- **Search & Perspectives**: Node discovery and custom perspectives

---

## 🚨 **Problem Statement**

The current dev-graph suffers from several critical shortcomings:

### **1. No Temporal Awareness**
- Nodes and relations appear frozen in amber
- Users cannot tell when requirements were added, refined, or deprecated
- No way to determine if seemingly related nodes actually existed years apart

### **2. Graph Hairball Effect**
- Poorly designed network diagrams become "tangled and frustrating" (Cambridge Intelligence)
- Current implementation offers only rudimentary toggles
- Quickly devolves into unreadable tangle on anything but smallest datasets

### **3. Lack of Interactive Depth**
- No timeline slider, diff view, or detailed node inspection
- Missing point-and-click exploration with search and perspectives
- No file histories, commit graphs, or blame annotations

### **4. No Success/Failure Insight**
- Without metrics tied to performance or adoption, we cannot identify:
  - Which architectural decisions were good or bad
  - What patterns led to successful implementations
  - How to avoid repeating past mistakes

---

## 🔍 **Research & Inspiration**

### **Git-Centric Analysis Tools**
- **GitKraken & GMaster**: Interactive branch explorers with drag-and-drop commits
- **GitLens for VS Code**: Colorful commit graphs, file-level history, blame annotations
- **GitUp**: Branch labyrinth rendering tens of thousands of commits in real-time

### **Graph Visualization Best Practices**
- **Cambridge Intelligence Guidelines**: "Effortless understanding of complex relationships"
- **Neo4j Bloom**: Point-and-click exploration with perspectives and custom styling
- **Neo4j Visualization Library (NVL)**: First-class Neo4j integration with React wrapper

### **JavaScript Libraries**
- **D3.js**: Flexibility and rich interactivity
- **Sigma.js**: Large networks with built-in force-directed layouts
- **Vis.js**: Simple APIs for dynamic graphs and timelines
- **React-Force-Graph**: Currently used, evaluate for performance

### **Timeline Libraries**
- **Vis-Timeline**: Interactive timelines with start/end dates, zooming, dragging
- **React-Chrono**: React-based timeline components

---

## 🎨 **Product Vision**

We envision a **Developer-Graph Evolution Service** that serves as a knowledge atlas for our codebase. At its heart is a temporal graph database built on Neo4j with git-derived timestamps. The frontend provides two synchronized panels:

1. **Timeline Panel**: Shows evolution of requirements, sprints, and files
2. **Graph Panel**: Reveals structural relationships with time-aware filtering

**Key Experience**: When you scrub through time, the graph highlights only nodes and edges relevant at that moment. Users can search for requirements, jump to implementations, inspect commits, and compare performance metrics before and after major changes.

---

## 🏗️ **Core Requirements**

### **1. Temporal Relationship Tracking (MANDATORY)**

#### **Git-Driven Timestamps (CRITICAL)**
- **ALL temporal data MUST be derived from git commits**
- Each node and relationship must store creation and modification commit hash/timestamp
- **Document and file timestamps are EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN**
- Use `git log --follow` for file evolution tracking
- Implement `git blame` for line-level change authorship

#### **Versioned Relationships**
- Relationship edges have start and end commit hashes
- Relations exist only during valid commit ranges
- Enable time-range queries and historical state reconstruction

#### **Sprint Mapping**
- Sprint nodes map to commit ranges
- `git_history_service` must map each sprint to commit hashes between start/end dates
- Attach all changes within sprint windows

#### **Entity Lifecycle Events**
- Track for each requirement, file, or document:
  - Creation, update, deprecation, replacement
  - Reasons (extracted from commit messages or PR descriptions)

#### **Temporal Queries**
- "Show state of node X on date Y"
- "List all changes affecting requirement R between commits A and B"
- "Find when feature F was deprecated and by what"

### **2. Enhanced Node & Relationship Types**

#### **Node Types**
```cypher
// Idea Nodes
CREATE (r:Requirement {
    id: "FR-123",
    title: "Feature X",
    author: "developer@example.com",
    date_created: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",  // From git
    goal_alignment: "Performance",
    tags: ["frontend", "critical"]
})

// Implementation Nodes
CREATE (f:File {
    path: "frontend/src/components/FeatureX.tsx",
    first_commit: "abc123",
    last_commit: "def456",
    total_commits: 25,
    authors: ["dev1@example.com", "dev2@example.com"],
    language: "typescript"
})

// Sprint Nodes
CREATE (s:Sprint {
    number: "Sprint-11",
    start_date: "2024-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_date: "2024-06-30T23:59:59Z",
    velocity: 85,
    commit_range: ["abc123", "def456"]
})

// Git Commit Nodes (Temporal Backbone)
CREATE (c:GitCommit {
    hash: "abc123",
    message: "Implement feature X",
    author: "developer@example.com",
    timestamp: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    branch: "main",
    files_changed: ["frontend/src/components/FeatureX.tsx"],
    lines_added: 150,
    lines_deleted: 20
})
```

#### **Relationship Types**
```cypher
// Core Relationships
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTS {commit: "abc123", timestamp: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"}]->(f:File)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:EVOLVES_FROM {commit: "def456", diff_summary: "Added validation"}]->(old_req:Requirement)
CREATE (old_file:File)-[:REFACTORED_TO {commit: "ghi789", refactor_type: "Component extraction"}]->(new_file:File)
CREATE (node:Node)-[:DEPRECATED_BY {commit: "jkl012", reason: "Performance issues"}]->(replacement:Node)

// Context Relationships
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:INSPIRED_BY {source: "Research paper X"}]->(research:Document)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:BLOCKED_BY {commit: "mno345", blocker: "Database dependency"}]->(blocker:Requirement)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:DEPENDS_ON {commit: "pqr678", dependency_type: "Infrastructure"}]->(dependency:Requirement)
```

### **3. Interactive Frontend Components**

#### **A. TimelineView (Chronological Visualization)**
- **Scale-aware timeline** using vis-timeline or react-chrono
- **Event stacking with participants** on lanes (requirement, file, sprint)

#### **C. Detail Drawers and Diff Views**
- **Node detail drawer**: Commit history, evolution timeline, implementation links
- **Diff viewer**: Code diffs for files, requirement evolution diffs
- **Commit explorer**: List commits with messages, authors, timestamps, changed files

### **4. Success and Pattern Analytics**

#### **Success/Failure Metrics**

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

This unified PRD transforms the original high-level vision into a concrete, implementable plan for an interactive, intuitive, and truly temporal dev-graph. By anchoring all temporal data to git history, borrowing best practices from graph visualization and git tools, and focusing on user experience and success metrics, we can build a system that not only shows relationships but tells the story of how the codebase evolves.

**Key Principles**:
- **Git history is the single source of truth** for all temporal data
- **User experience drives technical decisions** - avoid hairballs, enable exploration
- **Performance and scalability** are non-negotiable for large repositories
- **Success metrics must be objective** and tied to actual development outcomes

With careful implementation following this roadmap, this service will become a cornerstone of our development workflow and a model for how to visualize the life of a codebase. It will guide developers through the labyrinth of history and enable them to make better architectural decisions based on data-driven insights rather than intuition alone.
