# Codebase Evolution Tracking System - Updated PRD

**Sprint 11 Final Deliverable**  
**Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETED** | ✅ **Phase 2 COMPLETED** | 🚨 **Phase 3 IN PROGRESS**  
**Last Updated**: January 2025

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

Transform the current developer graph from a static relationship mapper into a dynamic **codebase evolution tracking system** that tells the story of how ideas, features, and architectural decisions evolved over time. The system will integrate git history, track idea lifecycles, and provide insights into what worked vs. what didn't.

**Core Vision**: A living, breathing knowledge atlas for our codebase that serves as both a temporal narrative and structural map, enabling developers to understand not just what the codebase is, but how it got there and what we can learn from that journey.

- **API Endpoints**: 5 new endpoints for temporal data access
- **Sprint Mapping**: Maps sprint windows to git commit ranges
- **Temporal Engine**: Ingests commits/files into Neo4j
- **Frontend Timeline**: Basic commit feed; commit-limit slider (not a time scrubber yet)
- **Tests**: 100% pass rate on GitHistoryService validation

### **✅ Phase 2: Evolution Tracking & UI - COMPLETED**

- **Sprint Data Integration**: Only 2 mock sprints visible, 11 real sprints not connected
- **Ingest Functionality**: Button returns errors, no proper error handling
- **Performance Issues**: No streaming/pagination, UI becomes unreadable with large datasets

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED (January 2025)**

### **1. Graph Visualization Failures**
- **Problem**: Labels appear randomly scattered across points, making graph unreadable
- **Root Cause**: Poor label positioning in `react-force-graph-2d`, no collision detection
- **Impact**: Users cannot read node labels or understand relationships
- **Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks basic usability

### **2. Data Loading Limitations**
- **Problem**: Hardcoded 1000 limits for both nodes and relations
- **Root Cause**: No pagination or streaming implementation
- **Impact**: Large codebases overwhelm the UI, no progressive loading
- **Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks scalability

### **3. Sprint Data Disconnect**
- **Problem**: Only 2 mock sprints visible, 11 real sprint directories exist but aren't ingested
- **Root Cause**: Sprint mapping exists but isn't connected to frontend
- **Impact**: Users cannot see actual project history or sprint evolution
- **Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Core functionality missing

### **4. Ingest Button Failures**
- **Problem**: Ingest button returns errors, no user feedback
- **Root Cause**: Potential Neo4j connection issues or git service dependencies
- **Impact**: Users cannot update graph data or add new commits
- **Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Core functionality broken

### **5. Missing UMAP-Style Streaming**
- **Problem**: No progressive loading like successful UMAP implementation
- **Root Cause**: All data loaded at once, no viewport-based loading
- **Impact**: UI becomes crowded and unresponsive with large datasets
- **Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Performance critical

- **React-Chrono**: React-based timeline components

---

## 🎨 **Product Vision**

We envision a **Developer-Graph Evolution Service** that serves as a knowledge atlas for our codebase. At its heart is a temporal graph database built on Neo4j with git-derived timestamps. The frontend provides two synchronized panels:

1. **Timeline Panel**: Shows evolution of requirements, sprints, and files
2. **Graph Panel**: Reveals structural relationships with time-aware filtering

**Key Experience**: When you scrub through time, the graph highlights only nodes and edges relevant at that moment. Users can search for requirements, jump to implementations, inspect commits, and compare performance metrics before and after major changes.

---

## 🏗️ **Core Requirements**

### **1. Temporal Relationship Tracking (MANDATORY)**

#### **Git-Driven Timestamps (CRITICAL)**
- **ALL temporal data MUST be derived from git commits**
- Each node and relationship must store creation and modification commit hash/timestamp
- **Document and file timestamps are EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN**
- Use `git log --follow` for file evolution tracking
- Implement `git blame` for line-level change authorship

#### **Versioned Relationships**
- Relationship edges have start and end commit hashes
- Relations exist only during valid commit ranges
- Enable time-range queries and historical state reconstruction

#### **Sprint Mapping**
- Sprint nodes map to commit ranges
- `git_history_service` must map each sprint to commit hashes between start/end dates
- Attach all changes within sprint windows

#### **Entity Lifecycle Events**
- Track for each requirement, file, or document:
  - Creation, update, deprecation, replacement
  - Reasons (extracted from commit messages or PR descriptions)

#### **Temporal Queries**
- "Show state of node X on date Y"
- "List all changes affecting requirement R between commits A and B"
- "Find when feature F was deprecated and by what"

### **2. Enhanced Node & Relationship Types**

#### **Node Types**
```cypher
// Idea Nodes
CREATE (r:Requirement {
    id: "FR-123",
    title: "Feature X",
    author: "developer@example.com",
    date_created: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",  // From git
    goal_alignment: "Performance",
    tags: ["frontend", "critical"]
})

// Implementation Nodes
CREATE (f:File {
    path: "frontend/src/components/FeatureX.tsx",
    first_commit: "abc123",
    last_commit: "def456",
    total_commits: 25,
    authors: ["dev1@example.com", "dev2@example.com"],
    language: "typescript"
})

// Sprint Nodes
CREATE (s:Sprint {
    number: "Sprint-11",
    start_date: "2024-06-01T00:00:00Z",

    velocity: 85,
    commit_range: ["abc123", "def456"]
})

// Git Commit Nodes (Temporal Backbone)
CREATE (c:GitCommit {
    hash: "abc123",
    message: "Implement feature X",
    author: "developer@example.com",
    timestamp: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    branch: "main",
    files_changed: ["frontend/src/components/FeatureX.tsx"],
    lines_added: 150,
    lines_deleted: 20
})
```

#### **Relationship Types**
```cypher
// Core Relationships
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTS {commit: "abc123", timestamp: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"}]->(f:File)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:EVOLVES_FROM {commit: "def456", diff_summary: "Added validation"}]->(old_req:Requirement)
CREATE (old_file:File)-[:REFACTORED_TO {commit: "ghi789", refactor_type: "Component extraction"}]->(new_file:File)
CREATE (node:Node)-[:DEPRECATED_BY {commit: "jkl012", reason: "Performance issues"}]->(replacement:Node)

// Context Relationships
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:INSPIRED_BY {source: "Research paper X"}]->(research:Document)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:BLOCKED_BY {commit: "mno345", blocker: "Database dependency"}]->(blocker:Requirement)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:DEPENDS_ON {commit: "pqr678", dependency_type: "Infrastructure"}]->(dependency:Requirement)
```

### **3. Interactive Frontend Components**

- **Scale-aware timeline** using react-chrono with interactive controls
- **Event stacking with participants** on lanes (requirement, file, sprint)
- **Time scrubber and playback controls** for interactive exploration
- **Auto-refresh functionality** with configurable intervals
- **Success/failure annotations** with icons and explanations
- **Zooming** from hours to years with drag navigation

#### **B. EvolutionGraph (Interactive Network View)**

- **Filtering & perspectives**: Advanced search with node/relationship type selection
- **Time-aware graph**: Responds to timeline slider with opacity/color changes
- **Node and edge styling**: Consistent colors, shapes, and hover tooltips
- **Clutter reduction**: Labels appear on hover; reduced clutter at scale

#### **C. Detail Drawers and Diff Views**
- **Node detail drawer**: Commit history, evolution timeline, implementation links
- **Diff viewer**: Code diffs for files, requirement evolution diffs
- **Commit explorer**: List commits with messages, authors, timestamps, changed files

### **4. Success and Pattern Analytics**

#### **Success/Failure Metrics**
- **Success criteria**: Meets acceptance criteria, remains active for N sprints without major refactoring
- **Failure indicators**: Deprecated within short window, high bug counts
- **Data sources**: Performance tests, adoption statistics, code quality tools

#### **Pattern Recognition Engine**
- Identify successful design patterns and anti-patterns
- Feed insights back into timeline via annotations
- Provide "Success Patterns" view for analysis

#### **Impact Analysis**
- Track downstream impacts when requirements/technologies are deprecated
- Summarize impacts to avoid repeating mistakes
