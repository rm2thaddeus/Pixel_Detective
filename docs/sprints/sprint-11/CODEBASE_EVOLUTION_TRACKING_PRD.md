- ✅ Color changes when modified (blue for growth, orange for mutations)
- ✅ Dramatic explosion animations when deleted
- ✅ Playback controls to step through commits
- ✅ Complete evolution timeline showing repository state at each point
- ✅ Biological metaphors throughout (organisms, generations, evolution, ecosystem)

**🎯 Vision Achievement**
The implementation successfully delivers on the original vision:
- "Watch your codebase evolve through time" ✅
- "Each commit represents a generation" ✅
- "Files are organisms that live and die" ✅
- "Files grow with modifications" ✅
- "Change color when modified" ✅
- "Explode when deleted" ✅
- "Use playback controls to step through commits" ✅

Primary files created/modified:
- `tools/dev-graph-ui/src/app/dev-graph/components/BiologicalEvolutionGraph.tsx`: Complete redesign with biological evolution metaphors
- `tools/dev-graph-ui/src/app/dev-graph/timeline/page.tsx`: Enhanced with dual-view system and improved playback controls
- Integration with existing `TemporalEvolutionGraph.tsx` for technical details view

### Dev Graph Layout Modes – Implementation Notes (Jan 2025)

Following `DEV_GRAPH_LAYOUT_MODES_EXPLORATION_PRD.md`, two dedicated modes were implemented in the dev graph UI (`tools/dev-graph-ui`):

- Structure Mode (force-directed)
- Time Mode (time‑radial)

Key details:

- Mode toggle with deep links. URL encodes: `mode=structure|time`, `seed=<int>`, optional `from`, `to`, and `focus`.
- Persistence: last mode and layout seed saved locally per user.
- Structure Mode: deterministic, seeded coordinate reuse to stabilize small filter changes; client force relax with early termination and sampling.
- Time Mode: deterministic radial layout with time bin layers; fade styling outside selected time range; escape hatch to open node neighborhood in Structure.
- Escape hatches both ways: clicking a node in Structure opens its time context in Time; clicking a node in Time switches to Structure and focuses node.
- Edge density throttling: light-edges reducer plus probabilistic throttling when edges exceed view budget.

Primary files touched:

- `tools/dev-graph-ui/src/app/dev-graph/complex/page.tsx`: mode toggle, deep-linking, persistence, and wiring.
- `tools/dev-graph-ui/src/app/dev-graph/components/EvolutionGraph.tsx`: seeded RNG, coordinate cache, time-radial bins, focus/time fading, density throttle.

KPIs tracked via debug UI and internal perf logs; further profiling planned for large datasets.

## Separation of Concerns: Backend Contracts vs Frontend UI

- Backend (contracts and performance)
  - Authoritative endpoints: `/api/v1/dev-graph/graph/subgraph`, `/commits/buckets`, `/evolution/*`, `/sprints/*/subgraph`, `/search/fulltext`.
  - Pagination: keyset for subgraph (cursor `{last_ts, last_commit}`) to avoid deep `SKIP`.
  - Ingestion triggers: POST endpoints to run enhanced docs/git ingestion.
  - Telemetry: `/metrics` or enhanced `/health` exposing `{avg_query_time_ms, cache_hit_rate}` for the UI.

- Frontend (rendering and interaction)
  - Default to `/graph/subgraph` + progressive pagination; avoid legacy `/nodes|/relations` for large graphs.
  - Sigma.js with LoD reducers; worker-based clustering/layout on large graphs.
  - Timeline uses bucketed density; Sprint Tree uses sprint subgraph; Analytics uses `/analytics/*`.

- **Impact**: Users cannot read node labels or understand relationships
- **Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks basic usability

### **2. Data Loading Limitations**
- **Problem**: Hardcoded 1000 limits for both nodes and relations
- **Root Cause**: No pagination or streaming implementation
- **Impact**: Large codebases overwhelm the UI, no progressive loading
- **Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks scalability

### **3. Sprint Data Disconnect**

## 🎨 **Product Vision**

We envision a **Developer-Graph Evolution Service** that serves as a knowledge atlas for our codebase. At its heart is a temporal graph database built on Neo4j with git-derived timestamps. The frontend provides two synchronized panels:

1. **Timeline Panel**: Shows evolution of requirements, sprints, and files
2. **Graph Panel**: Reveals structural relationships with time-aware filtering

**Key Experience**: When you scrub through time, the graph highlights only nodes and edges relevant at that moment. Users can search for requirements, jump to implementations, inspect commits, and compare performance metrics before and after major changes.

---

## 🧭 **Layout Modes: PRD Decision & Separation**

### Summary
- The force-directed layout and time-radial selector target orthogonal discovery goals. A single unified selector creates UX and performance conflicts. We will ship them as two separate exploratory features, each optimized for its strength, with a clear mode toggle in the UI.

### Compatibility Findings
- Force-directed excels at structural insight (clusters, hubs, neighborhoods) but offers weak temporal legibility; adding heavy temporal constraints degrades layout stability and performance.
- Time-radial excels at temporal narratives (when things appear/change) but suppresses spatial proximity and increases edge crossings for cross-time links.
- Attempting to hybridize produced trade-offs that harmed both: unstable layouts, increased jank on time scrub, and ambiguous positioning signals.

### Decision
- Introduce two explicit modes with dedicated controls, metrics, and rendering budgets:
  - Structure Mode: Force-directed (FA2) for relationship exploration.
  - Time Mode: Time-Radial for evolution storytelling and temporal analysis.

---

## 🌐 **Exploratory Feature A: Structure Mode (Force-Directed)**

### Goal
- Provide fast, stable structural exploration of subgraphs to reveal communities, hubs, and neighborhoods with interactive filtering.

### Primary Use Cases
- Cluster discovery, dependency mapping, “what is related to X?”, neighborhood expansion, cross-link inspection.

### Non-Goals
- High-fidelity temporal sequencing on canvas; narrative time is handled by Time Mode.

### Data & Inputs
- Windowed subgraph API, optional precomputed coordinates, community labels (Louvain), basic centrality scores.

### UX Requirements
- Smooth pan/zoom at >45 FPS for up to ~5k nodes in viewport.
- Interactive hover/select, neighborhood expand/collapse, community coloring.
- Optional edge bundling at medium+ sizes; hide labels-on-move.
- Stable positions across minor filters: cache or reuse coordinates when node sets are similar.

### Technical Approach
- Graphology + Sigma.js with ForceAtlas2 in a Web Worker.
- Early-termination layout with temperature/speed cap; resume on demand.
- Position persistence by node id; seeded RNG for determinism.
- Progressive loading and viewport-based rendering.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Hairball risk on dense graphs → default to degree/weight-based edge sampling, on-demand expansion.
- Layout thrash when filters change → reuse prior coords, partial relax only for entered/removed nodes.

### KPIs
- Time-to-first-frame < 1.0s for 30-day window.
- Interaction FPS > 45 during pan/zoom.
- Position stability score (JSD over node displacement) within target under minor filter changes.

---

## 🕘 **Exploratory Feature B: Time Mode (Time-Radial Selector)**

### Goal
- Deliver legible, compelling temporal narratives of how features, sprints, and files evolve over time, optimized for time scrubbing and storytelling.

### Primary Use Cases
- “What happened when?”, sprint windows, commit bursts, feature lifecycles, before/after comparisons.

### Non-Goals
- Precise community spatialization; structural proximity is secondary.

### Data & Inputs
- Commit buckets endpoint, sprint ranges, per-edge timestamps, evolution events.

### UX Requirements
- Radial layers binned by time (e.g., by week/sprint); inner→outer = older→newer or vice versa.
- Focus+context on selected entity; highlight first/last seen, change events, and active edges within selected range.
- Time scrubber synchronizes selection; optional playback.
- Edge filtering: show top-N salient edges per node (e.g., by recency/weight) to reduce crossings.

### Technical Approach
- Deterministic polar coordinates from time bins; angle reserved for categories (e.g., type/community) or stable hashing for repeatability.
- Arc/curve rendering with throttled edge density; fade inactive layers.
- Snapshot assembly server-side for a given time window to minimize client churn.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Edge crossing clutter across bins → cap visible edges, on-hover expansion; use bundling for cross-bin flows.
- Large windows produce dense rings → dynamic binning (auto-coarsen when density > threshold).

### KPIs
- Time scrub responsiveness < 100ms to update highlights.
- Readability rating in usability tests (task success on temporal questions) > baseline.
- Reduced cognitive load for “when” questions vs. Structure Mode.

---

## 🔀 **Mode Switching & Shared Contracts**
- Clear toggle: “Structure” vs “Time”. Persist last mode per user.
- Shared filters (type, sprint, search) apply in both; rendering honors mode semantics.
- Deep linkability: URL encodes mode, query, time range or layout seed.
- Escape hatches: from Time node click → open neighborhood in Structure Mode; from Structure node → open timeline for that node in Time Mode.

---

## 🏗️ **Core Requirements**

### **1. Temporal Relationship Tracking (MANDATORY)**

#### **Git-Driven Timestamps (CRITICAL)**
- **ALL temporal data MUST be derived from git commits**
- Each node and relationship must store creation and modification commit hash/timestamp
- **Document and file timestamps are EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN**
- Use `git log --follow` for file evolution tracking
- Implement `git blame` for line-level change authorship

#### **Versioned Relationships**
- Relationship edges have start and end commit hashes
- Relations exist only during valid commit ranges
- Enable time-range queries and historical state reconstruction

#### **Sprint Mapping**
- Sprint nodes map to commit ranges
- `git_history_service` must map each sprint to commit hashes between start/end dates
- Attach all changes within sprint windows

#### **Entity Lifecycle Events**
- Track for each requirement, file, or document:
  - Creation, update, deprecation, replacement
  - Reasons (extracted from commit messages or PR descriptions)

#### **Temporal Queries**
- "Show state of node X on date Y"
- "List all changes affecting requirement R between commits A and B"
- "Find when feature F was deprecated and by what"

## 🔧 Recent Technical Change (2025-09-04)

- Dev Graph UI dependency alignment to resolve install/build failures caused by peer conflicts:
  - `tools/dev-graph-ui`: React `19.1.0` → `18.3.1`, React DOM `19.1.0` → `18.3.1`
  - `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`: `^19` → `^18`
  - `react-chrono`: `^2.9.1` → `2.6.1` (React 19 requirement → React 18 compatible)
  - Rationale: Both `framer-motion@10.18.0` and `react-chrono@2.9.1` had peer dependency conflicts with React 19.
  - Result: Dependency installation and Next.js build now succeed; new pages compile under Next `15.5.2` with React `18.3.1`.
  - Follow-up: Revisit upgrade to React 19 once both `framer-motion` and `react-chrono` officially support it; then restore `@types/*` to `^19`.

- **Sigma.js v3 Module Import Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: Runtime error "Sigma: could not find a suitable program for node type 'circle'" due to invalid import paths
  - Root cause: Attempted to import non-existent modules `sigma/rendering/webgl/programs/node.circle` and `sigma/rendering/webgl/programs/edge.line`
  - Solution: Removed invalid imports; Sigma.js v3.0.2 uses default node/edge programs automatically
  - Changes: Removed explicit `nodeProgramClasses` and `edgeProgramClasses` configuration
  - Result: Graph rendering now works correctly; both `/dev-graph` and `/dev-graph/complex` pages load successfully

- **Automatic Data Loading Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: Time radial layout showed nothing because data wasn't being fetched automatically on component mount
  - Root cause: React Query queries were configured but not enabled for automatic fetching
  - Solution: Added `enabled: true` to all React Query configurations (nodes, relations, commits)
  - Result: Data now loads automatically when the page loads, enabling immediate use of time radial layout
  - Impact: Users no longer need to click "Ingest Latest" to see the evolutionary tree visualization

- **Analytics 404 Errors Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: Frontend was making requests to `/api/v1/analytics/*` endpoints that returned 404 errors
  - Root cause: Backend service was running an older version without analytics endpoints, or endpoints weren't properly deployed
  - Solution: Temporarily disabled RealAnalytics component and replaced with placeholder message
  - Changes: Commented out RealAnalytics import and replaced analytics tab with informative placeholder
  - Result: No more 404 errors in browser console; core functionality (evolutionary tree) remains fully functional
  - Follow-up: Re-enable analytics when backend is updated with latest API endpoints

- **Missing Pages Navigation Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: Additional pages (Enhanced Dashboard, Simple Dashboard) were created but not accessible through UI navigation
  - Root cause: Pages existed but were not properly routed and had no navigation links
  - Solution: Created proper Next.js route structure and added simple navigation links to each page
  - Changes: 
    - Moved `page-enhanced.tsx` to `/dev-graph/enhanced/page.tsx`
    - Moved `page-simple.tsx` to `/dev-graph/simple/page.tsx`
    - Added navigation links to each page showing current page and links to others
  - Result: All three pages are now accessible and users can navigate between them
  - Pages available:
    - `/dev-graph/complex` - Complex View (evolutionary tree, timeline, analytics)
    - `/dev-graph/enhanced` - Enhanced Dashboard (node/relation explorers, statistics)
    - `/dev-graph/simple` - Simple Dashboard (basic overview, API documentation)

- **React Hooks Order Error Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: React detected a change in the order of Hooks called by EnhancedDevGraphPage, causing console errors
  - Root cause: `useColorModeValue` hook was being called after conditional returns, violating Rules of Hooks
  - Solution: Moved all hook calls to the top of the component before any conditional returns
  - Changes: Pre-defined `pageBgColor` variable and moved all `useColorModeValue` calls to component top
  - Result: No more React Hooks order errors; all pages load without console errors
  - Impact: Enhanced Dashboard now works correctly without React warnings

- **Icon Import Error Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: `FiBarChart3` icon doesn't exist in react-icons/fi module, causing build errors
  - Root cause: Incorrect icon name used in PageNavigation component
  - Solution: Changed `FiBarChart3` to `FiBarChart` (correct icon name)
  - Result: All icon imports now work correctly; no more build errors
  - Impact: Navigation component renders properly with correct icons

- **Missing HStack Import Fix (2025-09-04)**:
  - Issue: Runtime ReferenceError "HStack is not defined" in Simple Dashboard page
  - Root cause: HStack component was used in the navigation section but not imported from @chakra-ui/react
  - Solution: Added HStack to the import statement in simple page
  - Changes: Updated import from `{ Box, Heading, Spinner, Text, VStack, Button }` to include `HStack`
  - Result: Simple Dashboard page now loads without runtime errors
  - Impact: All three pages (Complex, Enhanced, Simple) now work correctly with navigation

## 🧬 **Biological Evolution Metaphor Implementation (January 2025)**

### **New Architecture: Welcome-First Navigation**

**Problem Solved**: The dev graph was unusable due to poor navigation - users landed directly on a complex timeline view that was overwhelming and didn't show what they were interested in.

**Solution**: Implemented a biological evolution metaphor with clear navigation flow:

1. **Welcome Dashboard** (`/dev-graph/welcome`) - Entry point with system health, data quality metrics, and descriptive stats
2. **Timeline Evolution** (`/dev-graph/timeline`) - Biological evolution view with commits as generations, files as organisms
3. **Structure Analysis** (`/dev-graph/structure`) - Force-directed relationship analysis and architectural patterns

### **Biological Evolution Metaphor**

**Core Concept**: Codebase evolution as a living ecosystem where:
- **Commits = Generations**: Each commit represents a new generation in the evolution
- **Files = Organisms**: Files are living entities that are born, evolve, and sometimes die
- **Branches = Lineages**: Git branches represent evolutionary lineages that fork and merge
- **Documentation = DNA**: Documentation acts as regulatory instructions that influence code survival
- **Main Branch = Trunk**: The main branch is the trunk of the evolutionary tree

### **New Components Implemented**

#### **1. Welcome Dashboard** (`/dev-graph/welcome/page.tsx`)
- **System Health Overview**: API connectivity, database status, data quality score
