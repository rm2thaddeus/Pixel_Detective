# Codebase Evolution Tracking System - PRD

## Executive Summary
Transform the current developer graph from a static relationship mapper into a dynamic **codebase evolution tracking system** that tells the story of how ideas, features, and architectural decisions evolved over time. The system will integrate git history, track idea lifecycles, and provide insights into what worked vs. what didn't.

## Problem Statement
The current dev graph shows static relationships but lacks:
- **Temporal context**: When ideas were conceived, implemented, deprecated
- **Evolution tracking**: How requirements evolved across sprints
- **Git integration**: Links to actual code changes and commit history
- **Success/failure insights**: Which ideas succeeded vs. failed
- **Codebase navigation**: Direct links to relevant files and implementations

## Vision
A living, breathing map of the codebase that shows:
- **Idea genealogy**: Where each concept originated and how it spread
- **Implementation timeline**: When features were built, refactored, or removed
- **Success patterns**: What architectural decisions led to good outcomes
- **Failure analysis**: What approaches were tried and abandoned
- **Code navigation**: Direct links to relevant files, commits, and discussions

## Core Features

### 1. Temporal Relationship Tracking
- **Timeline view**: Show how relationships evolved over time
- **Sprint progression**: Track how requirements evolved across sprints
- **Git commit integration**: Link relationships to specific commits
- **Deprecation tracking**: Mark when ideas/features were abandoned

### 2. Enhanced Node Types
- **Idea nodes**: Conceptual requirements (FR/NFR)
- **Implementation nodes**: Actual code files/classes
- **Sprint nodes**: Time-based containers
- **Git commit nodes**: Version control checkpoints
- **Discussion nodes**: PRs, issues, documentation

### 3. Rich Relationship Types
- **EVOLVES_FROM**: How requirements changed over time
- **IMPLEMENTS**: Code that fulfills requirements
- **REFACTORED_TO**: How implementations evolved
- **DEPRECATED_BY**: What replaced old approaches
- **INSPIRED_BY**: External influences and research
- **BLOCKED_BY**: Dependencies and blockers

### 4. Git History Integration
- **Commit analysis**: Parse git logs for relationship changes
- **File evolution**: Track how files changed over time
- **Blame integration**: Who changed what and when
- **Branch tracking**: Feature branch lifecycle
- **Merge analysis**: How ideas were integrated

    author: "developer@example.com"
})

CREATE (f:File {
    path: "frontend/src/components/FeatureX.tsx",
    current_hash: "def456",
    created_at: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
})

// New relationship types
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTED_IN]->(f:File)
CREATE (f:File)-[:CHANGED_IN]->(c:GitCommit)
CREATE (req:Requirement)-[:DEPRECATED_IN]->(c:GitCommit)
CREATE (old:File)-[:REFACTORED_TO]->(new:File)
```

    def find_related_changes(self, node_id: str, time_range: TimeRange) -> List[Change]:
        """Find all changes related to a node in a time period"""

## Conclusion

This system represents a significant evolution from static relationship mapping to dynamic codebase storytelling. By integrating git history, tracking evolution, and providing temporal insights, we can create a powerful tool for understanding not just what the codebase is, but how it got there and what we can learn from that journey.

The technical foundation exists in tools like GitPython, Neo4j, and modern visualization libraries. The challenge lies in creating the right abstractions and algorithms to transform raw git data into meaningful insights about codebase evolution.

This PRD provides a roadmap for building a system that doesn't just show relationships, but tells the story of how ideas evolve, succeed, and sometimes fail - providing valuable lessons for future development decisions.
