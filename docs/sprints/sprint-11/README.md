# Sprint 11: Latent Space Visualization & Curation Suite

**Status:** 🚀 **PRODUCTION COMPLETE** | **Week:** 4/4 | **Progress:** All Core Features Delivered ✅
**Major Milestone:** 🎯 **Full Interactive Latent Space Explorer & Curation Suite LIVE**

**Sprint Duration:** January 2025 (4 weeks)

## 🎯 Sprint Overview

Sprint 11 has successfully delivered a **production-ready interactive latent space visualization** and a **comprehensive curation and duplicate management suite**. This transforms the application from a simple image viewer into a professional-grade archival and exploration tool. The system now provides an intuitive 2D exploration interface for CLIP embeddings, robust tools for ensuring database integrity, and a highly optimized backend infrastructure. All core features are complete, tested, and operational.

## 🎪 Core Features Delivered

### 1. Advanced Interactive Latent Space Explorer
- ✅ **2D UMAP Projections:** High-performance DeckGL visualization with WebGL acceleration.
- ✅ **Dynamic Clustering:** DBSCAN, K-Means, and Hierarchical algorithms with live parameter tuning and quality metrics (Silhouette Score).
- ✅ **Interactive Exploration:** Rich hover tooltips with image previews, click selection, and cluster highlighting.
- ✅ **Lasso Selection:** An `EditableGeoJsonLayer` allows users to draw custom polygons to select arbitrary groups of points.
- ✅ **Multi-layer Visualization:** A sophisticated layer system provides independent toggles for scatter points, convex hulls, density heatmaps, and terrain overlays.
- ✅ **Real-time Controls:** A dedicated sidebar allows for live, debounced parameter changes for all clustering algorithms with immediate visual feedback.
- ✅ **Collection Integration:** Create new collections directly from visual selections made with the lasso tool.

### 2. Comprehensive Curation & Duplicate Management Suite
- ✅ **Proactive Duplicate Suppression:** During ingestion, a real-time SHA-256 hash check prevents byte-for-byte identical duplicates from being processed or stored, ensuring database cleanliness from the start.
- ✅ **Automated Near-Duplicate Analysis:** A background task (`POST /api/v1/duplicates/find-similar`) scans collections for visually similar images (cosine similarity > 0.98), grouping them for review.
- ✅ **Interactive Curation UI:** A dedicated UI on the `/duplicates` page presents near-duplicate groups visually, allowing the curator to select and archive unwanted images.
- ✅ **Safe Archival Workflow:** A **zero data loss** principle is enforced. Archiving an image *moves* the original file to a `_VibeArchive` or `_VibeDuplicates` folder at the root of the ingest directory. This is a non-destructive, reversible action.
- ✅ **Qdrant Snapshot Safety:** Before any archival operation modifies the database, an atomic snapshot of the Qdrant collection is taken, allowing for instant rollback.

### 3. Backend Performance & Scalability Enhancements
- ✅ **Full CUDA Acceleration:** GPU-accelerated processing for UMAP and clustering via NVIDIA RAPIDS cuML, with automatic CPU fallback. The `cuml.accel.install()` approach provides zero-code-change acceleration for scikit-learn and UMAP.
- ✅ **PyTorch-Native Model Optimization:** The ML Inference Service now uses **half-precision (FP16)** loading and **`torch.compile()`** for both CLIP and BLIP models. This halves the VRAM footprint and allows the system's auto-tuner to **double the effective GPU batch size**.
- ✅ **Dynamic Batch Sizing:** The Ingestion service now auto-sizes `ML_INFERENCE_BATCH_SIZE` and `QDRANT_UPSERT_BATCH_SIZE` based on available system RAM and the ML service's reported GPU capabilities, optimizing throughput automatically.
- ✅ **Idempotent Collection Merging:** A robust `scroll` -> `upsert` pattern allows for multiple, year-based collections to be safely and periodically merged into a master collection without data loss or downtime.

## 🚀 Advanced Implementation Details

### CUDA Acceleration System
A key to performance is the automatic, hands-off GPU acceleration. By simply including `cuml.accel.install()` before other imports, standard scikit-learn and umap-learn calls are redirected to the GPU.
```python
# Automatic GPU acceleration with CPU fallback
try:
    import cuml.accel
    cuml.accel.install()
    CUDA_ACCELERATION_ENABLED = True
    logger.info("🚀 CUDA acceleration enabled")
except ImportError:
    logger.info("💻 Using CPU-only implementations")

# Standard imports are now automatically accelerated
import umap
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN, KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering
```

### Multi-layer Visualization Architecture
The frontend uses a conditional layer rendering system in Deck.gl, allowing users to toggle different visualization modes without performance penalty.
```typescript
// Advanced WebGL layer management
const layers = [
  // Density heatmap layer (conditional)
  ...(overlayMode === 'heatmap' ? [createHeatmapLayers()] : []),

  // Convex hull polygons (conditional)
  ...(showHulls ? [createHullLayers()] : []),

  // Main scatter plot points (conditional)
  ...(showScatter ? [createScatterLayer()] : []),

  // Lasso selection overlay (conditional)
  ...(lassoMode ? [createLassoLayer()] : []),
];
```

### Dynamic Batch Sizing
The ingestion service automatically tunes itself for the host hardware.
```python
# ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/utils/autosize.py
import os, psutil, httpx

def autosize_batches(ml_url: str):
    # 1. Ask the ML service for its GPU-safe batch size
    safe_clip = httpx.get(f"{ml_url}/api/v1/capabilities").json()["safe_clip_batch"]

    # 2. Estimate RAM-limited sizes based on available memory
    free_ram = psutil.virtual_memory().available
    ram_batch = int((free_ram * 0.60) / (2 * 1024 * 1024)) # 2 MB/img
    ram_upsert = int((free_ram * 0.10) / (6 * 1024))       # 6 KB/point

    ml_batch = max(1, min(safe_clip, ram_batch, 2048))
    qdrant_batch = max(32, min(ram_upsert, 2048))

    # 3. Set as environment variables, respecting manual overrides
    os.environ.setdefault("ML_INFERENCE_BATCH_SIZE", str(ml_batch))
    os.environ.setdefault("QDRANT_UPSERT_BATCH_SIZE", str(qdrant_batch))
```

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

- **Load Time:** <2s for 500 points, <5s for 1000+ points.
- **Interaction Latency:** <100ms for hover/click responses.
- **Clustering Updates:** <3s for parameter changes with visual feedback.
- **GPU Throughput:** **Doubled** effective batch size via FP16 and `torch.compile` optimizations.
- **CUDA Acceleration:** **10-300x speedup** on UMAP and clustering when available, with graceful CPU fallback.
- **Scalability:** The system is built to scale, with viewport culling for large datasets, progressive loading, and efficient memory management.
