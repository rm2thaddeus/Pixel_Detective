# Sprint 04 Completion Summary

**Achievements:**
- Implemented `TaskOrchestrator` module with `submit`/`is_running` APIs and global instance.
- Added unit tests ensuring single-thread enforcement and correct task lifecycle.
- Refactored sidebar Build/Load Database and Merge flows to run asynchronously via orchestrator, improving UI responsiveness.
- Updated sprint documentation with background task patterns and integrated thread-safety guidelines.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Initial app startup remains laggy due to heavy ML/data imports; further lazy-loading and skeleton screens are needed.
- Database build pipeline crashes at caption generation because `BLIP_MODEL_NAME` is undefined, causing pipeline failure.
- Background errors should be captured and surfaced gracefully in the UI rather than causing silent crashes.
- The orchestrator design could be extended with result capture, callbacks, and progress hooks for richer feedback.

**Blockers & Next Steps:**
- Define `BLIP_MODEL_NAME` constant or update caption extraction logic to prevent pipeline errors.
- Defer heavy ML imports until first use and leverage `PerformanceOptimizer` for critical modules to reduce startup lag.
- Enhance orchestrator with progress reporting and error callback hooks for real-time status updates.
- Plan Sprint 05 tasks: build FAST_UI, LOADING, ADVANCED_UI screens per UX_FLOW_DESIGN, and fix BLIP and performance issues.
