# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Pixel Detective application, including core modules, data flow, and key components.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Sprint 01 Complete**: Unified 3-Screen Architecture âœ…

**Status**: Successfully transformed fragmented dual UI system into unified 3-screen architecture  
**Achievement**: UI/UX integration complete with performance maintained  
**Result**: 
- âœ… **Unified user experience** - Single coherent 3-screen flow
- âœ… **Component integration** - All sophisticated features accessible  
- âœ… **Performance preserved** - <1s startup maintained
- âœ… **User-focused design** - Removed technical jargon, added engaging progress
- âœ… **Graceful fallbacks** - Components work with error handling

**Completed Transformations**:
1. **Screen 1**: Simplified user-focused folder selection (removed technical metrics)
2. **Screen 2**: Engaging progress experience (replaced boring technical logs)  
3. **Screen 3**: Sophisticated features integrated (real components with fallbacks)
4. **Component Architecture**: Extracted `ui/` components to organized `components/` structure

## âœ… **Current Status (Post-Sprint 08 / Planning Sprint 09)**

**Overall System Health:** Stable, with ongoing enhancements for robustness and feature set.
**Key Architectural Pillars:**
-   **API-Driven Frontend:** Streamlit application interacts with backend services exclusively through a dedicated API service layer (`frontend/service_api.py`).
-   **Decoupled Backend Services:** FastAPI applications manage specific domains like ingestion and ML inference.
-   **Persistent Vector Storage:** Qdrant collections are intended to be persistent and loaded at application startup (target for Sprint 09).
-   **Modular Frontend Components:** UI is built with reusable components, though continuous alignment with backend capabilities is ongoing.

**Sprint 08 Achievements Relevant to Architecture:**
-   Centralized backend interactions in `frontend/service_api.py`.
-   Developed new API endpoints for search, image listing, duplicates, random image, and vector visualization.
-   UI components (including `latent_space.py`) made API-driven and stateless.
-   Folder ingestion tasks from UI (`context_sidebar.py`) now submit tasks to the backend Ingestion Orchestration service via `service_api.py`.

**Sprint 09 Architectural Goals:**
-   Implement persistent Qdrant collections loaded at startup.
-   Mechanism to check for existing collections and prompt for folder-based creation if absent.
-   Enhance frontend to consume APIs for progress/log updates from the backend.
-   Full restoration and testing of "Folder Load" functionality with persistent Qdrant.

## 0. Environment Setup

- Use a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) for dependency isolation.
- Activate on Windows PowerShell: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- Activate on Unix/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- **Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch** for GPU acceleration. See the README for installation and troubleshooting instructions.
- If you see `torch.cuda.is_available() == False`, check your drivers and CUDA install, and ensure you have the correct PyTorch version for your CUDA toolkit.

## 1. Application Structure

The application is broadly divided into a `frontend` (Streamlit application) and a `backend` (FastAPI services), interacting with a `Data Layer` (Qdrant).

### 1.1. Frontend (`frontend/`)

-   **Streamlit App (`frontend/app.py`)**: Main entry point for the user interface. Implements the unified 3-screen experience. Relies on `service_api.py` for all backend communication.
-   **Configuration (`frontend/config.py`)**: Global settings for the frontend, potentially including Qdrant collection names or API endpoints.
-   **Core Logic (`frontend/core/`)**:
    -   `app_state.py`: Manages 3-screen state transitions.
    -   `background_loader.py`: Handles non-blocking progress tracking (to be enhanced with API-based feedback).
    -   `session_manager.py`: Manages session state.
-   **API Service Layer (`frontend/service_api.py`)**: Crucial module acting as the sole intermediary for communication with all backend FastAPI services. Uses `httpx.AsyncClient`.
-   **Screens (`frontend/screens/`)**: Implements the different stages of the UI flow (Fast UI, Loading, Advanced UI). All screens are API-driven.
-   **Components (`frontend/components/`)**: Reusable UI modules for search, visualization, sidebar, etc. These components fetch data and trigger actions via `service_api.py`.
-   **Styling (`frontend/styles/`, `frontend/.streamlit/custom.css`)**: Defines the visual appearance of the application.

### 1.2. Backend (`backend/`)

The backend consists of decoupled FastAPI services. For local development and testing, these services are run manually. Docker Compose is used to manage the Qdrant instance.

-   **Ingestion Orchestration (`backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/`)**:
    -   Manages the process of ingesting images from folders.
    -   Handles tasks like metadata extraction, embedding generation (potentially by calling the ML inference service), and storing data in Qdrant.
    -   Provides APIs for initiating and monitoring ingestion tasks (e.g., "Folder Load").
    -   Sprint 09 aims to make this service work with persistent Qdrant collections and provide progress updates.
-   **ML Inference (`backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app/`)**:
    -   Provides APIs for machine learning model inferences, primarily CLIP for embeddings and BLIP for captions.
    -   Likely called by the Ingestion Orchestration service during the ingestion pipeline.
    -   May also be used for on-the-fly inference if needed by other features (e.g., image search).
-   **Shared Models/Utilities (Conceptual)**: Common utilities, model loading logic, or database connectors specific to the backend might reside in shared modules accessible by these FastAPI apps.
-   **Node Modules (`backend/node_modules/`)**: Indicates potential use of Node.js tools, possibly for build processes, linting, or auxiliary scripts within the backend environment.
-   **Disk Cache (`backend/.diskcache/`)**: Suggests caching is used within the backend services.

### 1.3. Data Layer (Qdrant)

-   **Vector Database**: Qdrant is used for storing and searching image embeddings and metadata.
-   **Persistence (Sprint 09 Goal)**:
    -   Collections will be persistent.
    -   The application (likely the backend services or a startup script coordinated with them) will check for and load an existing collection by a configured name.
    -   If no collection exists, the UI (via `frontend/app.py` and `service_api.py` to the ingestion service) will prompt the user to specify a folder to build a new collection.
-   **Access**: Backend services interact directly with Qdrant using the Qdrant Python client. The frontend does not interact with Qdrant directly but goes through `service_api.py`.

**Note on Legacy Folders (`models/`, `database/`, `metadata_extractor.py`, `utils/` at root):**
The Sprint 08 PRD indicates a strong shift towards backend services and `frontend/service_api.py`. The roles of older top-level folders like `models/`, `database/`, `metadata_extractor.py`, and `utils/` need clarification. They might be:
1.  Legacy code primarily used by the `scripts/mvp_app.py`.
2.  Shared libraries/utilities now primarily consumed by the `backend/` services.
3.  Partially or fully superseded by logic within the backend services themselves.
This architecture document assumes they are increasingly supporting backend operations or are for CLI usage. The frontend relies on `service_api.py`.

## 3. Data Flow

*(This section is updated to reflect the API-driven architecture and planned Sprint 09 functionalities.)*

### A. Streamlit App (`frontend/app.py`) - API-Driven UI
1.  **Screen 1 - Fast UI**:
    -   User selects a folder (for initial collection creation if none exists and prompted based on S09 plans) or interacts with features assuming a collection is loaded.
    -   Actions (e.g., selecting folder, initiating search, choosing a tool) trigger calls to `frontend/service_api.py`.
2.  **Screen 2 - Loading Progress**:
    -   Displays progress information received from `service_api.py`. This service layer polls or receives updates from backend services about the status of long-running tasks (e.g., folder ingestion, complex searches), a feature to be enhanced in Sprint 09.
3.  **Screen 3 - Advanced Features**:
    -   All interactions (search, visualization, duplicate detection) make requests via `service_api.py` to the relevant backend FastAPI endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/search`, `/api/v1/duplicates` from S08 PRD).
    -   Results returned by the backend are processed by `service_api.py` and then rendered by the UI components.

### B. "Folder Load" / Initial Collection Creation (Sprint 09 Focus)
1.  **Startup Check**: Application startup sequence (likely initiated by `frontend/app.py` making a call through `service_api.py` to the `ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`) checks if the configured Qdrant collection exists.
2.  **Prompt (if no collection)**: If the collection is not found, the frontend UI (e.g., `fast_ui_screen.py`) presents an option to the user (e.g., a button or text input) to specify a local folder path for creating a new collection.
3.  **Initiate Ingestion**: Upon user action, the frontend calls an appropriate endpoint on the `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app` (via `service_api.py`), passing the folder path.
4.  **Backend Processing (Ingestion Service)**:
    -   The `ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app` processes the folder content:
        -   Extracts metadata from files.
        -   Coordinates with `ml_inference_fastapi_app` to get embeddings (and captions if applicable) for the images.
        -   Upserts the data (embeddings and metadata) into the persistent Qdrant collection.
    -   This service is responsible for providing progress updates that `service_api.py` can poll or receive, enabling the frontend to display status to the user.
5.  **UI Feedback**: The frontend (`loading_screen.py` or other relevant components) displays progress and completion/error status based on information from the backend.

### C. Backend Service Interaction
-   **Frontend to API Service Layer**: `frontend/app.py` (Streamlit UI) â†’ `frontend/service_api.py` (using `httpx.AsyncClient`).
-   **API Service Layer to Backend Services**: `frontend/service_api.py` â†’ Specific HTTP/S endpoints on `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app` or `backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app`.
-   **Inter-Service Backend Communication (Conceptual)**: `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app` may call `backend/ml_inference_fastapi_app` (e.g., via HTTP/S or direct Python calls if deployed in a tightly coupled manner, though separate HTTP calls maintain better decoupling).
-   **Backend Services to Data Store**: `backend/*_fastapi_app` â†’ Qdrant instance (using Qdrant Python Client).

### D. Latent Space Explorer (`frontend/components/visualization/latent_space.py`)
1.  The component, via `service_api.py`, calls a dedicated backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/vectors/all-for-visualization` as mentioned in Sprint 08 PRD) to fetch necessary data (embeddings, metadata).
2.  The backend service retrieves this data from the Qdrant collection.
3.  The frontend component then computes UMAP projections and DBSCAN clustering (or receives pre-computed data if the backend handles this processing step).
4.  Renders an interactive Plotly scatter plot in the Streamlit UI.

## 3.5. Hybrid Search System

*(This system is primarily implemented in the backend, orchestrated via `service_api.py` from the frontend.)*

### A. Query Processing (`utils/query_parser.py` - Assumed backend utility or integrated into backend search logic)
1.  **Query Parsing**: User input from the frontend is sent via `service_api.py` to the backend. The backend analyzes the query to extract metadata constraints and semantic query text.
2.  **Normalization & Filter Building**: The backend normalizes fields/values and creates Qdrant-compatible filters.

### B. Search Execution (Backend Service, e.g., a dedicated search router in one of the FastAPI apps, using `database/qdrant_connector.py`)
1.  **Vector Encoding**: Text queries are encoded using CLIP on the backend.
2.  **Hybrid Search**: The backend service uses Qdrant's Query API, potentially with RRF, combining vector search with metadata boosting/filtering.
3.  **Result Fusion & Return**: The backend combines scores and returns ranked results to `service_api.py`, which then passes them to the frontend.

### C. Metadata Field Mapping (Backend Responsibility)
-   The backend maintains mappings for comprehensive metadata coverage and aliases.

### D. Search Logic Principles (Implemented in Backend)
-   The backend search endpoint embodies these principles (always return results, boost don't block, etc.).

## 4. Batch Processing & Results

-   **Backend Ingestion Service (`ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`)**: Handles batch processing of images from folders, including metadata extraction, embedding (via ML service), and Qdrant upsertion.
-   **CLI MVP (`scripts/mvp_app.py`)**: Provides alternative headless batch processing capabilities. Its direct interaction with Qdrant or backend services should be clarified if it's still a primary tool for data preparation.
-   Batch sizes are configurable within the respective backend services or CLI tool.

## 5. RAW/DNG Image Support

-   Handled by the `backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app` during the ingestion pipeline, likely utilizing `rawpy` before sending image data to the `ml_inference_fastapi_app` for embedding/captioning.

## 6. Static Assets & Test Data
-   **`.streamlit/static/`**: Contains app icons (e.g., `detective.png`).
-   **`Library Test/`**: Contains test images and scripts for development/testing.
-   **`docs/`**: Documentation, including this file, roadmap, and changelog.

## 7. Deployment & Scaling

-   **Frontend (`frontend/app.py`)**: Deployed as a standard Streamlit application.
-   **Backend Services (`backend/*_fastapi_app`)**: FastAPI services are designed to be containerized (e.g., using Docker) and can be deployed independently or as a group (e.g., via Docker Compose for local development, or Kubernetes/serverless functions for cloud deployment).
-   **QdrantDB**: Supports both local (via Docker Compose) and remote/cloud deployments. The choice depends on the scale and operational requirements.
-   The decoupled nature of backend services allows for individual scaling based on load (e.g., scaling the ML inference service if it becomes a bottleneck).
-   Designed for consumer GPUs (6GB VRAM minimum) for local ML tasks, but can fall back to CPU. Cloud deployments of ML services can leverage more powerful GPU instances.

## 8. File/Directory Structure (Current - Post Sprint 08 / Planning S09)
*(Refer to consolidated structure in Section 2. This heading is a placeholder if content was here previously)*

## 9. Architectural Evolution Summary (High-Level)

*(This new section summarizes the journey from Sprint 01 to current state)*

-   **Sprint 01**: Focused on unifying a fragmented dual UI system into a cohesive 3-screen Streamlit frontend. Key activities included component extraction from the old `ui/` folder into a new `components/` structure and establishing the `fast_ui_screen`, `loading_screen`, and `advanced_ui_screen` flow. Performance (<1s startup) was a key consideration.
-   **Sprints 02-07 (Assumed Broad Strokes)**: Likely focused on visual design enhancements (e.g., Sprint 02 Visual Design System & Accessibility), progressive feature additions, backend service groundwork, and initial Qdrant exploration. The specifics of architectural changes in these sprints would need to be drawn from their respective PRDs/summaries.
-   **Sprint 08**: A pivotal sprint that solidified the API-driven architecture. All frontend-to-backend communication was centralized through `frontend/service_api.py`. Backend functionalities were more clearly delineated into FastAPI services (`ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`, `ml_inference_fastapi_app`) providing endpoints for search, image listing, duplicate detection, random image generation, and vector visualization data. Docker Compose for Qdrant was established for local development. UI components became fully API-driven and stateless.
-   **Sprint 09 (Planned)**: Aims to enhance robustness and user experience by introducing persistent Qdrant collections loaded at application startup. This includes implementing a check for existing collections and providing a UI mechanism to create new collections from user-specified folders if none exist. Further improvements include integrating more detailed progress/log feedback from backend APIs into the frontend and conducting comprehensive application testing, particularly for the "Folder Load" functionality.

---

**ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Post Sprint 09 Implementation & Beyond):**

-   **Implement and Test Sprint 09 Goals**: Successfully deliver persistent Qdrant, robust folder loading with UI prompts, and enhanced API-driven feedback.
-   **Refine Backend Service APIs**: Based on frontend needs and performance testing, iterate on API design for clarity, efficiency, and error reporting.
-   **Scalability and Performance Tuning**: For both backend services and Qdrant, especially with large datasets.
-   **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement more comprehensive monitoring and structured logging across frontend and backend services for easier debugging and operational insight.
-   **Expand Test Coverage**: Continue to build out unit, integration, and E2E tests for all critical paths and new features.
-   **Documentation**: Keep this `architecture.md` document, along with sprint-specific documentation and API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI specs for FastAPI services), up-to-date.
-   **Address Legacy Code**: Strategically refactor or retire parts of the older top-level folders (`models/`, `database/`, `utils/`) as their functionality is fully absorbed or better managed by the backend services or `frontend/service_api.py`.
