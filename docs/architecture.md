# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Pixel Detective application, including core modules, data flow, and key components.

## 0. Environment Setup

- Use a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) for dependency isolation.
- Activate on Windows PowerShell: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- Activate on Unix/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- **Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch** for GPU acceleration. See the README for installation and troubleshooting instructions.
- If you see `torch.cuda.is_available() == False`, check your drivers and CUDA install, and ensure you have the correct PyTorch version for your CUDA toolkit.

## 1. Application Modes

- **Streamlit App (`app.py`)**: Interactive UI for image search, exploration, and AI games.
- **CLI MVP (`scripts/mvp_app.py`)**: Command-line tool for batch ingestion, embedding, captioning, and database creation. Optimized for large-scale, headless processing.

## 2. Core Modules & Directory Structure

- **config.py**: Global settings (e.g., GPU memory efficiency, model loading).
- **models/**
  - `clip_model.py`: CLIP model logic, including DNG/RAW support and batch processing.
  - `blip_model.py`: BLIP model logic for captioning.
  - `model_manager.py`: Loads and manages models for the Streamlit app.
  - `lazy_model_manager.py`: On-demand model loading with smart swapping.
- **metadata_extractor.py**: Extracts file metadata and image EXIF data.
- **database/**
  - `qdrant_connector.py`: QdrantDB class for all vector DB operations (batch upsert, search, collection management).
  - `db_manager.py`: Higher-level DB management for the Streamlit app.
  - `vector_db.py`: (Legacy, used by Streamlit app; new code uses `qdrant_connector.py`.)
- **ui/**
  - `main_interface.py`, `sidebar.py`, `tabs.py`: Streamlit UI components for search and games.
  - `latent_space.py`: Latent Space Explorer tab for embedding visualization (UMAP & Plotly scatter) with cached projections, dynamic sampling, and interactive click/lasso selection.
- **utils/**
  - `image_utils.py`: Image loading, resizing, preprocessing.
  - `logger.py**: Standardized logging.
  - `cuda_utils.py`: CUDA checks and memory usage logging.
  - `incremental_indexer.py`: File system watcher and incremental indexing logic.
  - `embedding_cache.py`: Cache for embedding computations.
  - `lazy_session_state.py`: Progressive session state management.
- **scripts/**
  - `mvp_app.py`: CLI MVP for batch processing.
  - `diagnose_cuda.py`: GPU diagnostics.
  - `minigame.py`: AI guessing game prototype.
  - `run_app.bat`: Windows launcher for the Streamlit app.

## 3. Data Flow

### A. Streamlit App (`app.py`)
1. User selects or uploads an image folder via the sidebar.
2. `ModelManager` loads CLIP and BLIP models (with device selection and optional quantization).
3. `metadata_extractor.py` processes images for metadata.
4. `DatabaseManager` (using `db_manager.py` and `qdrant_connector.py`) stores embeddings and metadata in Qdrant.
5. UI components (`ui/`) display search results, comparisons, and game interactions.

### B. CLI MVP (`scripts/mvp_app.py`)
1. User runs the script with a folder path.
2. Images are processed in batches:
   - CLIP embeddings (with DNG/RAW support)
   - BLIP captions (parallelized)
   - Metadata extraction
3. Batch upsert to Qdrant via `QdrantDB`.
4. Optionally outputs a summary (`results_summary.txt`) and a detailed CSV.

### C. Latent Space Explorer (`ui/latent_space.py`)
1. Fetch embeddings and metadata via `DatabaseManager.get_latent_space_data()`.
2. Compute and cache 2D UMAP projection of embedding vectors for responsive rerenders.
3. Render a minimal, robust Plotly scatter plot (using plotly.graph_objects) for all points.
4. **DBSCAN clustering overlay:** After UMAP projection, DBSCAN is run on the 2D coordinates. Points are colored by cluster label, with outliers (noise, label -1) shown in gray. A sidebar slider allows interactive tuning of the DBSCAN `eps` (cluster radius) parameter. This enables visual exploration of clusters and outliers in the embedding space.
5. Extensive UI debugging was required: Plotly/Streamlit can silently fail to render points if marker/color/selection properties are misused. The current approach prioritizes reliability and clarity.

## 3.5. Hybrid Search System

The Pixel Detective search system implements a sophisticated hybrid approach combining vector similarity with metadata filtering:

### A. Query Processing (`utils/query_parser.py`)
1. **Query Parsing**: Analyzes user input to extract:
   - Metadata constraints (e.g., `camera:canon`, `iso:100`)
   - Semantic query text for vector search
   - Field aliases (e.g., `aperture_value` → `aperture`)
2. **Normalization**: Converts all fields and values to lowercase for consistent matching
3. **Filter Building**: Creates Qdrant-compatible filters using SHOULD (OR) logic instead of restrictive MUST (AND) logic

### B. Search Execution (`database/db_manager.py`, `database/qdrant_connector.py`)
1. **Vector Encoding**: Text queries are encoded using CLIP for semantic similarity
2. **Hybrid Search**: Uses Qdrant's Query API with RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion):
   - Primary vector search for semantic relevance
   - Metadata boosting for exact matches
   - Soft constraint filtering that enhances rather than restricts results
3. **Result Fusion**: Combines vector similarity scores with metadata match scores

### C. Metadata Field Mapping
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports 80+ metadata fields from EXIF/XMP extraction
- **Field Aliases**: Maps extracted field names to user-friendly query terms
- **Automatic Enrichment**: Extracts year from date fields, normalizes camera makes/models
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: All string comparisons use case-insensitive logic

### D. Search Logic Principles
- **Always Return Results**: Users always see relevant images, even with non-matching filters
- **Boost, Don't Block**: Metadata filters boost relevance rather than create hard restrictions
- **Flexible Queries**: Natural language works alongside technical specifications
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Vector search provides baseline results, metadata refines ranking

## 4. Batch Processing & Results

- **Batch size** is configurable for both CLIP and BLIP (CLI MVP).
- **Results summary**: CLI MVP can print and save a summary of all processed images, captions, and embedding status (`--save-summary` flag).
- **Detailed CSV**: CLI MVP can output a CSV with all metadata, captions, and embedding status.

## 5. RAW/DNG Image Support

- DNG/RAW files are handled natively in both the Streamlit app and CLI MVP.
- When a DNG file is encountered, it is loaded using `rawpy` and converted to RGB before processing by CLIP/BLIP.

## 6. Static Assets & Test Data

- **.streamlit/static/**: Contains app icons (e.g., `detective.png`).
- **Library Test/**: Contains test images and scripts for development/testing.
- **docs/**: Documentation, including this file, roadmap, and changelog.

## 7. Deployment & Scaling

- Designed for consumer GPUs (6GB VRAM minimum), but falls back to CPU.
- Batch processing and memory-efficient options for large collections.
- QdrantDB supports both local and remote (cloud) deployments.
- CLI MVP can be run headless for large-scale ingestion.

## 9. Notes

- For large image collections, processing may take time; GPU acceleration is highly recommended.
- The CLI MVP is the preferred tool for initial database creation and bulk ingestion.
- The Streamlit app is ideal for interactive exploration, search, and demonstration.
