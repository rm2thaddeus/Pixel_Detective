*Status: Successfully completed - Unified 3-screen architecture*

### **Sprint Achievements** ✅
- **Unified User Experience**: Transformed fragmented dual UI system into cohesive 3-screen flow
- **Component Architecture**: Extracted sophisticated components from `ui/` to organized `components/` structure
- **Performance Preserved**: Maintained <1s startup throughout all transformations
- **User-Focused Design**: Removed technical jargon, added engaging progress experience
- **Graceful Integration**: All sophisticated features accessible with fallback handling

### **Completed Deliverables** ✅
- [x] **Screen 1 Simplification**: User-focused folder selection (removed technical metrics)
- [x] **Screen 2 Enhancement**: Engaging progress with excitement-building messages
- [x] **Screen 3 Integration**: Sophisticated components with graceful fallbacks
- [x] **Component Extraction**: Organized `components/` directory with search, visualization, sidebar
- [x] **Documentation Suite**: Complete Sprint 01 docs with PRD, technical plan, completion summary

---

## ✅ **Sprint 02 - Sprint 07: Incremental Development & Foundational Work**
*Status: Summarized as complete leading to Sprint 08 capabilities*

### **Key Achievements (S02-S07)** ✅
- Progressive feature enhancements based on initial architecture.
- Development of core AI functionalities (CLIP, BLIP integrations - later moved to backend services).
- Iterative UI improvements and component development.
- Initial Qdrant exploration and performance optimizations.
*(Specific sprint details for S02-S07 can be found in their respective archived documentation if available, this roadmap now focuses on S08 onwards due to significant architectural shifts.)*

---

## ✅ **Sprint 08 COMPLETED: Qdrant Integration & Frontend Decoupling**
*Status: Successfully completed - Major architectural overall and feature delivery. **Identified critical "folder load" regression post-refactor.** *

### **Sprint Achievements** ✅
- **Qdrant Integration**: Fully integrated Qdrant for `/api/v1/search` and `/api/v1/images` endpoints, replacing placeholder logic.
- **New Feature Delivery (UI & Core Logic)**:
    - Duplicate Detection: UI functional, displays groups; backend algorithm finalization for S09.
    - Random Image Selection: Fully functional UI and API.
    - Advanced Filtering & Sorting: UI controls and backend support for enhanced image listing.
- **Major Frontend Refactor**: 
    - All UI screens are now API-driven via `frontend/core/service_api.py`.
    - UI is stateless, improving maintainability and predictability.
    - `frontend/components/visualization/latent_space.py` refactored to be API-driven using a new `/api/v1/vectors/all-for-visualization` backend endpoint.
- **Backend Services Established**: FastAPI services for ML inference (`ml_inference_fastapi_app`) and ingestion/orchestration (`ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`) are now core components.
- **Standardized UI Elements**: Improved error handling, loading states (spinners, progress) for new/refactored S08 components.
- **Dependency Management**: Optimized `requirements.txt` for both frontend and backend services.
- **Identified Regression**: Critical "folder load" functionality broken post-refactor, requiring immediate attention in S09.

### **Completed Deliverables** ✅
- [x] Functional Qdrant-powered search and image listing APIs and UI integration.
- [x] UI for Duplicate Detection, Random Image, Advanced Filtering & Sorting.
- [x] Fully refactored, API-driven, and stateless frontend architecture.
- [x] Established FastAPI backend services for core operations.
- [x] Detailed Sprint 08 documentation (`PRD.md`, `TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`).
- [x] **Carry-over to S09**: Full backend implementation for duplicate detection, comprehensive testing, and regression fixes.

---

## ✅ **Sprint 09 COMPLETED: Backend Validation, GPU Optimisation & Streamlit Removal**
*Status: Successfully completed - The backend is now feature-complete, highly optimized, and fully decoupled.*

### **Sprint Achievements** ✅
- **High-Performance Backend**: Refactored the ML inference and ingestion services for significant performance gains (~89% on key benchmarks) by implementing dynamic batching, GPU optimization, and asynchronous processing.
- **Robust Vector Storage**: Fully integrated Qdrant for persistent, scalable vector storage.
- **Legacy UI Deprecation**: Completely removed the original Streamlit frontend, eliminating a significant amount of legacy code and preparing the project for a modern UI framework.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Updated all backend architecture documents, developer roadmaps, and sprint-level documentation to reflect the current state of the project.
- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed obsolete directories (`frontend`, `screens`, etc.) and enhanced `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean.

### **Completed Deliverables** ✅
- [x] A feature-complete, high-performance, and stable backend.
- [x] The removal of the entire legacy `frontend` directory.
- [x] A comprehensive suite of up-to-date documentation for the backend architecture and Sprint 09.
- [x] A clean and well-organized repository, ready for the next phase of development.

## 🚀 **Sprint 10: Critical UI Refactor**
*Priority: Critical - Implement the new user-facing application.*
*Timeline: Approx. 3-4 weeks (estimate)*
*Theme: **Building a Modern Frontend:** Create a fast, responsive, and feature-rich user interface using Next.js, TypeScript, and Chakra UI.*

### **Sprint Goals**
- Deliver a fully functional web application that connects to the existing high-performance backend.
- Implement all core user flows, including project creation, log streaming, search, and data visualization.
- Establish a robust, component-based architecture for the frontend that is maintainable and scalable.
- Create a comprehensive end-to-end test suite to ensure application reliability.
- Prepare the application for modern deployment workflows on a platform like Vercel.
