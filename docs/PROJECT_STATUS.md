- **Feature Completeness**: 🟡 Backend features are complete. Frontend is the next major piece of work.
- **Documentation**: ✅ All backend and sprint documentation has been updated. Project is in a well-documented state.
- **Testing**: 🟡 Backend has basic tests, but comprehensive E2E and integration tests will be part of the new frontend sprint.

### Current Development Phase
- **Active Sprint**: [Sprint 10 – Critical UI Refactor](./sprints/critical-ui-refactor/README.md) (**Planning**)
- **Last Milestone**: [Sprint 09 – Backend Validation, GPU Optimisation & Streamlit Removal](./sprints/sprint-09/README.md) complete ✅
- **Next Focus**: Implementing the new Next.js frontend as per the [technical implementation plan](./sprints/critical-ui-refactor/technical-implementation-plan.md).

## 🏗️ **Architecture Status**

### Current System Architecture (Post Sprint 09)
```
✅ SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE
├── backend/
│   ├── ml_inference_fastapi_app/    # Handles ML model inference (CLIP, BLIP)
│   └── ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app/ # Handles data ingestion, Qdrant interaction
├── utils/service_api.py             # Centralized API client for future frontend
├── qdrant/                          # Qdrant vector database (managed via Docker)
└── docs/
    ├── sprints/
    │   ├── sprint-09/               # Sprint 09 docs (PRD, README)
    │   └── critical-ui-refactor/    # Docs for the upcoming UI sprint
    └── ARCHITECTURE.md              # Detailed backend architecture
```

### Architecture Health Metrics
- ✅ **Decoupling**: Backend is fully decoupled and ready for any modern frontend.
- ✅ **API-Driven**: The entire application logic is exposed via a comprehensive and documented API. See [`backend/ARCHITECTURE.md`](/backend/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between the two backend services and the database.
- 🟡 **Test Coverage**: Needs significant improvement, to be addressed with the new frontend.

## 🎨 **User Experience Status**

- **Current State**: There is currently no user interface for the application.
- **Archived Patterns**: Key UI/UX ideas and patterns from the legacy Streamlit UI have been archived in `docs/archive/sprint_09_frontend_ideas` for reference.
- **Next Steps**: The new user experience will be built from scratch using Next.js and Chakra UI, following the designs and requirements outlined in the [Critical UI Refactor PRD](./sprints/critical-ui-refactor/PRD.md).
