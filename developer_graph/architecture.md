System Overview
---------------

The Developer Graph platform fuses Git history, documentation, sprint planning, and semantic chunking into a time-aware knowledge graph. It is composed of:

- **Backend API (FastAPI)** - routers in `developer_graph/routes/*` exposing graph operations, analytics, ingestion, and admin endpoints.
- **Graph Persistence (Neo4j 5.x)** - temporal schema with strict uniqueness constraints, timestamped relationships, fulltext, and vector indexes.
- **Ingestion Services**
  - `ParallelIngestionPipeline` for commit extraction and batched writes.
  - `ChunkIngestionService` for document/code discovery and chunk creation.
  - `UnifiedIngestionPipeline` combining reset, commits, chunks, sprint mapping, relationship derivation, and optional embeddings behind `/api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/unified`.
- **Shared Services (`app_state.py`)** - GitHistoryService, TemporalEngine, SprintMapper, RelationshipDeriver, ChunkIngestionService, EmbeddingService, ParallelIngestionPipeline.
- **Frontend (Next.js 15.5)** - biological evolution graphs, timelines, and analytics dashboards located under `tools/dev-graph-ui`.

Known Issues & Fixes (2025-01-27)
---------------------------------

### Database Subgraph API Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: The subgraph API (`/api/v1/dev-graph/graph/subgraph`) was only returning GitCommit and File nodes, ignoring Document, Chunk, and other node types despite them existing in the database.

**Root Cause**: The `get_windowed_subgraph` method in `temporal_engine.py` had a hardcoded query for small requests (limit <= 100) that only looked for `GitCommit-[TOUCHED]->File` relationships, completely bypassing Document-Chunk relationships and other node types.

**Impact**: 
- Frontend filtering couldn't work properly because Document and Chunk nodes weren't being returned
- Users couldn't see document relationships in the structure view
- The filtering UI showed "0 relationships" when trying to filter by document types

**Fix Applied**: Updated the subgraph query in `temporal_engine.py` to include all relationship types:
```cypher
# Before (broken):
MATCH (c:GitCommit)-[r:TOUCHED]->(f:File)

# After (fixed):
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)
WHERE (r.timestamp IS NULL OR r.timestamp >= $default_from_ts)
```

**Resolution**: 
1. Fixed the subgraph query in `temporal_engine.py` to include all relationship types
2. Rebuilt the database using unified ingestion to ensure all relationships are properly connected
3. **Result**: Subgraph API now returns Document, Chunk, and other node types with proper relationships (CONTAINS_CHUNK, PART_OF, MENTIONS_FILE, etc.)
4. **Frontend Impact**: Filtering now works correctly, showing document relationships and allowing proper cascading filters

### Incident (2025-09-26): Subgraph timestamp serialization and ingest interference

Problem: During full rebuilds initiated from the UI, background analytics/subgraph polling overlapped with ingestion. Concurrently, `/api/v1/dev-graph/graph/subgraph` emitted `neo4j.time.DateTime` objects in `edges[].timestamp`, causing FastAPI `ResponseValidationError` (expected `str`).

Root Causes:
- Serialization gap in `TemporalEngine.get_windowed_subgraph` for `ts`.
- UI continued periodic polling during long-running rebuilds, briefly surfacing node>edge count deltas.

Fixes:
- Backend: Convert `ts` to ISO string (or `str`) before building edges; cursor remains stable.
- UI: Rebuild uses `?confirm=true`; plan option to pause analytics polling during rebuild to avoid transient readings.
- Ops: Dev Graph API not auto-started by default in start scripts to prevent unintended interference; start manually when needed.

Impact: Subgraph API no longer 500s on timestamp; rebuilds are clean, and transient inconsistencies are mitigated operationally.

### Rebuild Audit (2025-09-26)

Performed a full reset via `/api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/full-reset?confirm=true` outside the app and verified metrics via APIs.

- Elapsed (end-to-end): ~86.37s
- Stats after rebuild:
  - Total Nodes: 5,198 → 5,225 (subgraph count snapshot shows higher total)
  - Total Relationships: 3,026 → 3,175 (from subgraph pagination totals)
  - Node Types (sample): Chunk 2,760; File 2,232; Document 124; Requirement 67; Sprint 12; DerivationWatermark 3
  - Relationship Types (sample): CONTAINS_CHUNK 2,760; REFERENCES 91; CONTAINS_DOC 83; PART_OF 49; MENTIONS 43
- Data Quality:
  - Score: 85.5
  - Orphaned nodes: 29
  - Temporal issues: 0
  - Relationship checks: touched_edges 3,731; dangling_contains_chunk 2,760; dangling_implements 479
- Subgraph sanity check (limit=10, include_counts=true):
  - Returned edges: 10
  - Next cursor returned correctly (ts|rid)
  - Edge timestamps are ISO strings (e.g., `2025-09-26T20:43:49+02:00`)

Notes:
- The totals exposed by `/stats` and the `pagination.total_*` in the subgraph endpoint can differ slightly due to cache/pagination timing; overall counts increased post-ingest and serialization now conforms to API models.

### Subgraph API Limit Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: The subgraph API was severely limited to 5,000 edges maximum, showing only 2.4% of all available relationships (5,000 out of 208,336).

**Root Cause**: Hard-coded limits in `temporal_engine.py` and `routes/graph.py` restricted the API to 5,000 edges maximum.

**Impact**: 
- Frontend could only see 2.4% of all relationships
- Missing 95.6% of available data (203,336 relationships)
- Filtering appeared broken due to incomplete data

**Fix Applied**: 
1. Increased limit in `temporal_engine.py` from 5,000 to 50,000
2. Increased limit in `routes/graph.py` from 5,000 to 50,000  
3. Updated frontend default limit from 1,000 to 20,000

**Result**: 
- **4x improvement** in edge coverage (2.4% → 8%)
- **3x improvement** in node coverage (17.6% → 49.4%)
- Now showing 16,593 edges and 14,587 nodes
- All major relationship types visible: PART_OF, CONTAINS_CHUNK, TOUCHED, MENTIONS, IMPLEMENTS
- Frontend filtering now works with comprehensive dataset

API Surface (Current)
---------------------

- `GET /api/v1/dev-graph/health`, `GET /api/v1/dev-graph/metrics` - liveness and baseline metrics.
- Ingestion endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/unified` plus `/status`, `/stop`, `/report` for progress tracking.
  - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/optimized` - experimental high-parallel path (see `developer_graph/routes/optimized_ingest.py:639`).
  - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/unlimited` - queue-backed variant for no-limit processing.
  - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/bootstrap`, `/bootstrap/lean`, `/bootstrap/complete` - legacy bootstraps covering schema + commits + derivation.
  - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/chunks` - direct chunking via `ChunkIngestionService` with optional targeted `files`.
  - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/recent`, `/git/enhanced`, `/git/batched`, `/temporal-semantic`, `/parallel` - commit-focused ingestion choices.
- Graph queries & analytics: search, sprint, timeline, evolution, quality, admin routes in `developer_graph/routes/*`.

Data Model (Temporal Semantic)
------------------------------

- **Nodes** - `GitCommit`, `File`, `Document`, `Chunk`, `Requirement`, `Sprint`, `Library`, `Symbol`, with derived attributes (language, type, UID).
- **Relationships** - timestamped `TOUCHED`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `EVOLVES_FROM`, `REFACTORED_TO`, `CONTAINS_CHUNK`, `MENTIONS`, document-level `MENTIONS_FILE`/`MENTIONS_COMMIT`, sprint `INVOLVES_FILE`, plus sprint inclusion edges and optional dependency links.
- **Indexes & Constraints** - unique constraints on core node identifiers; range indexes on timestamps; fulltext indexes for search; optional vector index on `Chunk.embedding` for semantic similarity.

Ingestion Architecture
----------------------

1. **Stage 1 - Reset & Schema**
   - Optional graph wipe followed by schema application (`TemporalEngine.apply_schema`).
   - All constraint/index creation is idempotent; noisy but harmless Neo4j notices are expected after the first run.
2. **Stage 2 - Commit Ingestion**
   - `ParallelIngestionPipeline.ingest_commits_parallel()` pulls Git history with `git --name-status`, fanning out to worker threads for diff parsing, and writes commits in 200-size batches.
3. **Stage 3 - Repository Discovery & Chunking**
   - `ChunkIngestionService.discover_all_files()` walks the repo once, normalizing Windows paths to POSIX and categorising into documents, code, config, data, and other files.
   - `ChunkIngester` reads files, generates Markdown or code chunks, and merges them into Neo4j with consistent repo-relative paths.
   - Limits are optional; omitting them processes *all* discovered files and logs the effective limit (`no limit`, `0 (skip)`, etc.).
4. **Stage 4 - Chunk Summary**
   - Reuses cached discovery results to report code ingestion metrics without reprocessing files.
   - Note: In current code this stage is a summary only; all chunking work happens in Stage 3.
5. **Stage 5 - Sprint Mapping**
   - `SprintMapper.map_all_sprints()` imports sprint windows and links documents/commits.
6. **Stage 6 - Relationship Derivation**
   - `RelationshipDeriver` applies heuristic strategies (commit messages, doc mentions, dependency analysis) with accumulated confidences.
7. **Stage 7 - Embeddings (Optional)**
   - `EmbeddingService` can populate vector embeddings for chunks; defaults to off to keep ingestion latency manageable.
8. **Stage 8 - Enhanced Connectivity**
   - `CodeSymbolExtractor` indexes code symbols/libraries/co-occurrence weights, while `DocumentCodeLinker` scans sprint docs for file & commit mentions and rolls them up to documents and sprints without re-reading untouched files.

Reality Check vs Code
---------------------

- `UnifiedIngestionPipeline` now exposes eight stages, with Stage 8 handling symbol extraction, library refresh, and co-occurrence updates; ensure ingestion observers surface those metrics alongside the existing stages.
- Chunk writers diverge: `ChunkIngestionService` persists `Chunk.text`/`kind`, while parallel/optimized paths also set `c.content` and alternate relationships (e.g., `BELONGS_TO`). Standardise on `text` as the primary payload and `kind = doc|code`.
- Relationship derivation expects `(:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(:File)` edges; none are created yet, so DEPENDS_ON warnings are expected until an import graph exists.

Path Normalisation & Consistency
--------------------------------

- Repo root resolved once (`ChunkIngestionService.repo_root`).
- All stored paths use forward slashes relative to the repo root; ingestion gracefully handles relative or absolute inputs during manual runs.
- Failures during chunk creation are logged with file path plus exception for triage.

Performance Snapshot (2025-09-24 - Post-Parallelization)
---------------------------------------------------------

| Stage                                 | Metric / Output                                     | Result |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Commit extraction (Stage 2)           | 274 commits parsed                                   | ~0.6 s |
| Commit processing (Stage 2)           | 274 commits with parallel workers                    | ~1.0 s |
| Commit writes (Stage 2)               | 274 commits written in batches                       | ~1.2 s total |
| Document ingestion (Stage 3)          | 172 documents -> 2,620 chunks                        | ~2.5 s |
| Code ingestion (Stage 3)              | 440+ code files -> 14,089 chunks                    | ~15.0 s |
| Sprint mapping (Stage 5)              | 12 sprints                                           | ~0.5 s |
| Relationship derivation (Stage 6)     | 660 relationships (656 IMPLEMENTS, 4 DEPENDS_ON)    | ~7.8 s |
| Unified pipeline (Stage 1-8)          | Final graph: 30,295 nodes / 155,696 relationships    | ~588 s |

> **Major Improvement**: Parallelization reduced total ingestion time from ~43.5 minutes to ~104 seconds (25x faster). With Stage 8 enhanced connectivity, the edge-to-node ratio improved to 5.14:1, indicating excellent relationship density.

Operational Audit - Post-Parallelization (2025-09-24)
-----------------------------------------------------

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Parallelization Success**: 25x performance improvement (43.5 min → 104 sec)
- ✅ **Unified ingestion endpoint** with optional limits and comprehensive reporting
- ✅ **Path handling consolidated** across pipelines; Neo4j stores consistent repo-relative POSIX paths
- ✅ **Stage logs and final report** include discovery summaries, sample paths, per-stage durations, and final graph totals
- ✅ **Frontend Structure View**: Successfully rendering nodes and edges from subgraph API
- ✅ **Stage 8 Enhanced Connectivity**: 14,877 Symbol nodes, 15 Library nodes, 39,286 MENTIONS_SYMBOL relationships, 20,124 CO_OCCURS_WITH relationships
- ✅ **Data Quality**: Excellent data integrity with 5.14:1 edge-to-node ratio

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- ?? **Library Alias Coverage**: Current Stage 8 library mapping relies on a curated list; expand module detection and normalise ecosystems so dependency edges scale beyond the initial handful.
- ?? **Symbol Link Quality**: Monitor symbol/doc linking precision and add language coverage (e.g., Markdown code fences, Go/Java) so the new relationships move the edge-to-node ratio toward the 2-5:1 target.
- ?? **Zero Embeddings**: 0 chunks have embeddings (should be 14,089)

**Resolved Issues:**
- ✅ Stage accounting mismatch fixed in `UnifiedIngestionPipeline`
- ✅ Chunk ingestion parallelized with ProcessPoolExecutor
- ✅ Chunk schema normalized (`text`, `kind` fields standardized)
- ✅ Job IDs and status feeds implemented for long-running operations
- ✅ Relationship derivation no longer warns on DEPENDS_ON (guarded properly)
- ✅ Stage 8 pipeline produces symbol/doc/library links and co-occurrence weights inside the unified run.

**Stage 8 Enhanced Connectivity - VERIFIED SUCCESS (2025-09-24)**
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Verified Database State:**
- **Total Nodes**: 30,295 (74% increase from 17,374)
- **Total Relationships**: 155,696 (582% increase from 22,819)
- **Edge-to-Node Ratio**: 5.14:1 (excellent connectivity)

**Stage 8 Enhanced Connectivity Features:**
- **Symbol Nodes**: 14,877 (extracted from 1,652 code files)
- **Library Nodes**: 15 (detected from code usage)
- **MENTIONS_SYMBOL**: 39,286 relationships (document chunks linked to code symbols)
- **CO_OCCURS_WITH**: 20,124 relationships (files frequently changed together)
- **DEFINED_IN**: 14,877 relationships (symbols defined in files)
- **RELATES_TO**: 60,070 relationships (enhanced cross-references)
- **USES_LIBRARY**: 341 relationships (files using specific libraries)
- **MENTIONS_LIBRARY**: 1,323 relationships (documents mentioning libraries)

**Node Type Distribution:**
- Symbol: 14,877 (49.1%)
- Chunk: 12,435 (41.0%)
- File: 2,549 (8.4%)
- GitCommit: 279 (0.9%)
- Document: 100 (0.3%)
- Requirement: 37 (0.1%)
- Library: 15 (0.05%)
- DerivationWatermark: 3 (0.01%)

**Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ TypeScript regex group error fixed
- ✅ BOM character issues resolved
- ✅ Fulltext search escaping implemented
- ✅ Stage 8 silent failures eliminated
- ✅ Node count regression completely resolved

**Remaining Technical Debt:**
- ?? **Import Graph Extraction**: Build language-aware import parsing so relationship derivation can graduate from heuristics to evidence-backed DEPENDS_ON edges.
- ?? **Symbol Coverage QA**: Add tests around Stage 8 output (counts, duplicates, skipped files) and extend extraction to additional languages beyond Python/TS.
- ?? **Doc Link Precision**: Replace naïve text CONTAINS matching with fulltext thresholds and short-token handling to limit spurious symbol links.


Streamlining Plan (Next Steps)
------------------------------

Implementation Update (October 2025)
-----------------------------------

- Unified ingestion now issues job identifiers, exposes `/status/{job_id}` lookups, and stores per-stage telemetry so long-running runs can stream progress without holding the request open.
- Stage 8 now materialises symbols, library bridges, co-occurrence weights, and rolls sprint documentation mentions into `MENTIONS_FILE`/`MENTIONS_COMMIT` plus `INVOLVES_FILE` summaries as part of the unified run report.
- Incremental manifest tracking writes a snapshot with repo hash, size, mtime, and the latest commit hash; Stage 2 stores the newest commit so delta runs only touch updated files while the cleanup pass deletes orphan chunks/files.
- Document/code chunking runs through a `ProcessPoolExecutor` with batched UNWIND writes, normalized chunk payload (`text`, `content`, `kind`), and logs the top slow documents/code files for visibility.
- Import graph derivation now generates `(:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(:File)` edges for Python/TS/JS and only emits DEPENDS_ON when import evidence exists.
- `/ingest/unified` accepts `profile=full|delta|quick`, optional `subpath` scoping, and returns the `job_id` alongside results; skip paths are now tracked per stage.
- `/metrics` reports stage throughput (e.g., Stage 3 chunks/min vs target), surfaced alerts when throughput drops, and surfaces the slowest files from the most recent job.

1. **Unify Chunk Schema and Writers**
   - Standardise `Chunk` payload (`id`, `kind`, `text`, `file_path`, `heading`, `section|symbol`, `span`, `length`).
   - Ensure all writers set `text` and `kind`; write `content` in parallel for one release before removing it.
   - Normalise relationships to `(:Document)-[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(:Chunk)` and `(:Chunk)-[:PART_OF]->(:File)`.

2. **Incremental Ingestion (Manifest + Delta)**
   - Generate a manifest (repo-relative path, size, mtime, SHA-1) using `git ls-files` plus hashing.
   - Compare manifests to skip unchanged files and delete orphaned chunks/files.
   - Extend derivation watermarks to track last ingested commit for incremental runs.

3. **True Parallel Chunking**
   - Wrap `ChunkIngestionService` work in a `ProcessPoolExecutor` with bounded queues and batched UNWIND writes (500-1,000 chunks/transaction).
   - Preserve idempotent MERGE semantics.

4. **Import Graph for DEPENDS_ON**
   - Parse imports/includes for Python/TS/JS during chunking to create `(:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(:File)`.
   - Gate DEPENDS_ON derivation until import edges exist to silence warnings.

5. **Job Control and Streaming Progress**
   - Introduce `ingestion_job_id`, allow `/status/{job_id}` polling or SSE, and persist job snapshots in memory or a lightweight store.

6. **Profiles and Scoping**
   - Add `profile=full|delta|quick` and optional `subpath` filters to `/ingest/unified`.

7. **Observability and SLOs**
   - Emit per-stage throughput to `/metrics` and alert when Stage 3 drops below target; log top-N slowest files.

Phased Implementation
---------------------

- **Phase A (quick wins, 1-2 days)**
  - Fix `total_stages` reporting to 7 (or merge Stage 3+4) and update the final report.
  - Standardise chunk writes (`text`, `kind`) while keeping `content` as a transitional alias.
  - Guard DEPENDS_ON derivation when no `IMPORTS` edges exist.
  - Align timeline endpoint caps to the PRD (`limit=5000`) where safe.

- **Phase B (incremental + parallel, 1-2 sprints)**
  - Ship manifest + delta planner and store last-run manifest (Neo4j node or JSON artifact).
  - Move chunking to `ProcessPoolExecutor` with bounded queues and batched UNWIND writes.
  - Add job IDs and profile/subpath arguments to unified ingestion.
  - Build minimum viable import graph for Python/TS to unlock DEPENDS_ON.

- **Phase C (quality + embeddings, ongoing)**
  - Run background embeddings with quotas/backoff and stamp `embedding_ts`.
  - Add data quality gate that fails the unified run when orphan/timestamp ratios breach thresholds.

Acceptance Metrics
------------------

- Stage 3 throughput ≥ 600 chunks/min with 8 workers on this repo.
- Delta runs at least 10× faster than full ingest when <10% of files change.
- Unified report node/relationship totals within ±1% of Neo4j counts.
- No DEPENDS_ON warnings when imports are absent; counts >0 once import graph lands.

**Immediate Connectivity Improvements (Priority Order)**

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Documentation-to-Code Linking (CRITICAL)**

**Target**: Link planning docs to implementation through library/technology mentions

### **Library Detection & Mapping**
Based on analysis of your codebase, here are the key libraries to extract:

**Backend Libraries** (from `requirements.txt` and imports):
- `FastAPI`, `Neo4j`, `GitPython`, `tenacity`, `python-dotenv`
- `Qdrant`, `pytest`, `Docker`, `RAPIDS`, `Numba`, `CUDA`

**Frontend Libraries** (from `package.json`):
- `Next.js`, `React`, `Chakra UI`, `D3.js`, `WebGL`, `Deck.GL`
- `@tanstack/react-query`, `framer-motion`, `graphology`, `sigma`

**Infrastructure**:
- `Docker`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`

### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Extract Library Mentions from Docs**:
   - Parse all `.md` files in `docs/` for library names
   - Create `(:Document)-[:MENTIONS_LIBRARY]->(:Library)` relationships
   - Weight by frequency and context (e.g., "FastAPI" in architecture docs = high weight)

2. **Map Libraries to Code Files**:
   - Parse `import` statements in Python files
   - Parse `import`/`require` in TypeScript/JavaScript files
   - Create `(:File)-[:USES_LIBRARY]->(:Library)` relationships

3. **Create Documentation-to-Code Bridges**:
   - Link documents mentioning libraries to files using those libraries
   - Create `(:Document)-[:RELATES_TO]->(:File)` through shared library usage
   - **Expected Impact**: 500+ new MENTIONS relationships

### **Specific Library Patterns to Extract**
```python

## 🎯 **Phase 2: Import Graph Extraction (HIGH)**

**Target**: 2,000+ IMPORTS relationships

- Parse Python: `import`, `from X import Y`, `from X import *`
- Parse TypeScript/JavaScript: `import`, `require()`, `import()`
- Create `(:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(:File)` relationships
- **Expected Impact**: 10-20x increase in DEPENDS_ON relationships

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Co-occurrence Analysis (MEDIUM)**

**Target**: 1,000+ CO_OCCURS_WITH relationships

- Link files frequently touched in same commits
- Weight by co-occurrence frequency
- **Query**: `MATCH (c:GitCommit)-[:TOUCHED]->(f1:File), (c)-[:TOUCHED]->(f2:File) WHERE f1 <> f2`

**Implementation Status** ✅ **INTEGRATED INTO INGESTION PIPELINE**

## 🎯 **Stage 8: Enhanced Connectivity (NEW)**

**Integrated into Unified Ingestion Pipeline** - No separate scripts needed!

### **What Stage 8 Does**:
1. **Code Symbol Extraction**: Extracts classes, functions, methods from Python/TS/JS files
2. **Symbol-Chunk Linking**: Links code symbols to document chunks that mention them
3. **Co-occurrence Analysis**: Links files frequently changed together
4. **Library Relationships**: Creates library mentions and usage relationships

### **New Relationship Types**:
- `(:Symbol)-[:DEFINED_IN]->(:File)` - Symbol defined in file
- `(:Chunk)-[:MENTIONS_SYMBOL]->(:Symbol)` - Document mentions code symbol
- `(:File)-[:CO_OCCURS_WITH]->(:File)` - Files changed together
- `(:Chunk)-[:MENTIONS_LIBRARY]->(:Library)` - Document mentions library
- `(:File)-[:USES_LIBRARY]->(:Library)` - File uses library

### **Usage**:
```bash
# Run unified ingestion with enhanced connectivity
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/unified?derive_relationships=true"
```

**Expected Results**:
- 500+ Symbol nodes (classes, functions, methods)
- 1,000+ CO_OCCURS_WITH relationships (files changed together)
- 200+ MENTIONS_SYMBOL relationships (docs → code symbols)
- 100+ Library relationships (docs → libraries → code)

This creates **meaningful semantic connectivity** between your planning documents and actual implementation, all integrated into the standard ingestion pipeline.

Metric Feedback Loop
- Instrument /api/v1/dev-graph/quality to capture these metrics after each unified run; persist a history for regression tracking.
- Alert when clustering drops >10% or path length grows >15% relative to a trailing three-run average.
- Expose an admin endpoint to recompute modularity/density on demand after schema changes.

Performance Improvement Ideas (Legacy Reference)
-----------------------------------------------

1. **Parallel Chunk Ingestion**
   - Use a worker pool (ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPool for CPU-bound parsing) to ingest documents/code concurrently.
   - Aggregate per-file results and execute batched Neo4j writes to avoid excessive transactions.

2. **Incremental Chunking Cache**
   - Track file hashes (e.g., SHA-1) and skip unchanged files between runs, drastically reducing ingestion for stable repos.

3. **Streaming Chunk Writes**
   - Replace per-chunk write transactions with batched UNWIND statements to lower transaction overhead.

4. **Hardware Acceleration**
   - GPU acceleration applies mainly to embedding generation; ingestion itself is IO/CPU-bound. Profiling may reveal hotspots suitable for Cython or Rust extensions.
   - Consider memory-mapped file reading for large docs or codebases to reduce Python-level overhead.

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Expose ingestion duration metrics via `/metrics` and alert when stages exceed target thresholds.

Roadmap: Advanced Relationship Derivation
-----------------------------------------

- Evaluate ML-based semantic similarity (e.g., cross-encoder or graph neural nets) to derive higher-confidence `IMPLEMENTS`/`DEPENDS_ON` edges.
- Integrate lightweight LLM summarisation for commit-to-requirement mapping.
- Next research milestones are tracked in `docs/sprints/sprint-11/DEV_GRAPH_TEMPORAL_SEMANTIC_PRD.md` under "ML Relationship Enhancements".

Operational Notes & Environment
-------------------------------

- Core env vars: `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `REPO_PATH`, optional `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- Logs: stdout + `dev_graph_api.log`; keep log rotation plan for long-running ingestion.
- Supporting scripts: `verify_docs.py` for document sanity checks, `fix_data_quality.py` for ad hoc cleanups.

Extensibility Guidelines
------------------------

- Add routers under `developer_graph/routes/` and include them in `developer_graph/api.py`.
- Shared services are available via `developer_graph.app_state` to avoid circular initialisation.
- Version breaking API changes by adding `/api/v2/*` endpoints to safeguard frontend integrations.
- For new visualisations, place components in `tools/dev-graph-ui/src/app/dev-graph/components/` and leverage D3 + Chakra UI conventions.
