Developer Graph Services ‚Äî Architecture Overview

Status: Current as of Sprint 11 - Biological Evolution UI Implementation

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Quick Developer Graph API reload (from repo root)
python -m uvicorn developer_graph.api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Complete stack startup
./start_app.ps1

# Frontend only (from tools/dev-graph-ui)
npm run dev
```

### Path normalization and document ingestion (Sprint 11)

- All `Document.path` and chunk `doc_path` values are stored as repo‚Äërelative POSIX paths (e.g. `docs/sprints/critical-ui-refactor/README.md`).
- Both Enhanced and Parallel ingestion pipelines normalize paths consistently:
  - Enhanced: `enhanced_ingest.py` `_normalize_repo_relative_path()`
  - Parallel: `parallel_ingestion.py` `_normalize_repo_relative_path()`
- Titles: markdown document titles are extracted from the first heading and stored in `Document.title`.
- Chunk links: `Document` ‚àí[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]‚Üí `Chunk` use normalized paths; verification shows zero mismatches.

Operational notes:
- Reset and bootstrap:
  - DELETE `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/reset?confirm=true`
  - POST `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/bootstrap?reset_graph=true&commit_limit=2000&derive_relationships=true&include_chunking=true`
- Verification helper: run `python verify_docs.py` from repo root to print counts, sample titles, and path checks.

3. Data Model (Temporal Semantic)
- Nodes
  - GitCommit {hash, message, author, timestamp, branch?, uid}
  - File {path, language?, is_code?, is_doc?, extension?, uid}
  - Requirement {id, title?, description?, author?, date_created?, tags?, uid}
  - Document {path, name?, title?, type?, uid}
  - Chunk {id, doc_path?, heading?, level?, ordinal?, content_preview?, length?, kind?, text?, embedding?, uid}
  - Sprint {number, name?, start_date?, end_date?, uid}
- Relationships (selected)
  - (GitCommit)-[:TOUCHED {change_type, additions?, deletions?, timestamp}]->(File)
  - (Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTS {sources, confidence, commit?, timestamp, provenance?}]->(File)
  - (Requirement)-[:EVOLVES_FROM {sources, confidence, commit?, timestamp, diff_summary?}]->(Requirement)
  - (File)-[:REFACTORED_TO {commit, refactor_type?, timestamp}]->(File)
  - (Sprint)-[:INCLUDES]->(GitCommit)
  - (Sprint)-[:CONTAINS_DOC]->(Document)
  - (Document)-[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(Chunk)
  - (Chunk)-[:MENTIONS]->(Requirement)
  - (Sprint)-[:MENTIONS]->(File) (structural planning reference)

4. Schema & Indexing
- Constraints: unique on GitCommit.hash, File.path, Requirement.id, Chunk.id, Document.path, Sprint.number
- Property Indexes: GitCommit.timestamp, File.path, Requirement.id, Chunk.id
- Relationship Indexes: timestamp index on TOUCHED/IMPLEMENTS/EVOLVES_FROM/DEPRECATED_BY/REFACTORED_TO
- Fulltext: file_fulltext, requirement_fulltext, commit_fulltext, chunk_fulltext, document_fulltext
- Vector: Chunk.embedding (cosine), 512 dims (if available)

5. Ingestion Flows
- TemporalEngine (developer_graph/temporal_engine.py)
  - ingest_recent_commits, *_batched, *_parallel
  - time_bounded_subgraph, get_commits_buckets, evolution timelines
  - Creates GitCommit + File + TOUCHED(timestamp), derives IMPLEMENTS from commit messages; detects refactors
- EnhancedDevGraphIngester (developer_graph/enhanced_ingest.py)
  - Sprints, documents, chunk extraction, mentions, references
  - Batch UNWIND operations for performance
- EnhancedGitIngester (developer_graph/enhanced_git_ingest.py)
  - Commit analysis and provenance; sprint rollups; doc chunk modifications
  - Uses GitCommit + TOUCHED(timestamp), and structural MENTIONS for planning
- Bootstrap (routes/ingest.py)
  - Apply schema ‚Üí enhanced docs ‚Üí parallel commit ingest ‚Üí sprint mapping ‚Üí optional chunking ‚Üí relationship derivation

6. Evidence‚ÄëBased Relationship Derivation
- RelationshipDeriver (developer_graph/relationship_deriver.py)
  - IMPLEMENTS: commit‚Äëmessage (0.9), doc‚Äëmention (0.6), code‚Äëcomment proxy (0.8)
  - EVOLVES_FROM: pattern extraction from commit messages (replaces/evolves from/supersedes)
  - DEPENDS_ON: import graph best‚Äëeffort mapping (when File‚Äë[:IMPORTS]->File exists)
  - Confidence accumulation: `1 - (1 - prev) * (1 - new)`; sources appended
  - Watermarks: maintain `DerivationWatermark` per strategy

7. API Contracts (selected)

- GET /api/v1/dev-graph/stats: StatsResponse (consolidated query)
- GET /api/v1/dev-graph/graph/subgraph: WindowedSubgraphResponse

- Consolidated stats query (single round‚Äëtrip)
- Batched UNWIND writes across ingesters
- Parallel ingestion pipeline for commits and chunks

9. Logging & Telemetry

13. Extensibility Guidelines
- Add a new router under `developer_graph/routes/` and include it in `developer_graph/api.py`
- Access shared services via `developer_graph/app_state.*`
- Keep endpoint paths stable to avoid FE breakage; add versioned variants if contracts change
- For new relationship derivations, add a strategy to RelationshipDeriver with clear source + confidence math
- For new UI visualizations, add components to `tools/dev-graph-ui/src/app/dev-graph/components/`
- Use D3.js for custom visualizations, Chakra UI for standard components
