# Dev Graph API Refactor Plan - Consolidated Data Engineering Analysis

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses critical schema inconsistencies and API alignment issues identified in the current dev graph implementation. The primary goal is to unify the temporal schema across all ingestion endpoints and ensure the API fully supports the UI requirements for windowed subgraphs, timeline views, and sprint hierarchies.

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Senior data engineer analysis reveals the original plan has significant over-engineering risks and missing implementation details. This consolidated version focuses on **evidence-based relationship derivation** with **confidence scoring** and **lean implementation** that maximizes UI utility while minimizing risk.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Temporal Engine**: Properly implements `GitCommit`/`TOUCHED` with timestamps
- **API Endpoints**: Core endpoints exist and are functional
- **UI Integration**: React Query hooks are properly implemented
- **Schema Foundation**: Temporal schema helpers are well-designed
- **Git History Service**: Comprehensive git analysis with commit metadata, file history, and blame support
- **Sprint Mapping**: Maps sprint date ranges to git commit ranges
- **Multiple Ingestion Patterns**: Various specialized ingesters for different data sources

### ❌ Critical Issues Identified

#### **🚨 BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix First)**
1. **Schema Inconsistency Crisis**: `enhanced_git_ingest.py` uses `Commit`/`TOUCHES` while temporal engine uses `GitCommit`/`TOUCHED` - creates split-brain problem where UI timeline views miss half the data
2. **Missing Timestamps**: Enhanced ingest creates relationships without timestamps, making them invisible to temporal queries
3. **Analytics Bugs**: Line 922 uses `"commits": count_nodes("Commit")` instead of `"GitCommit"`, and line 926 filters structural edges by timestamp, returning zero counts
4. **Label Mismatches**: UI expects `GitCommit` but enhanced ingest creates `Commit`

#### **🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GAPS**
5. **Missing Relationship Derivation Logic**: No concrete implementation for evidence-based confidence scoring
6. **Over-Engineering Risk**: Original plan proposes 3 new major components (UnifiedIngestionOrchestrator, RelationshipDeriver, DataValidator) - violates lean startup principle
7. **Incomplete Schema**: Missing several relationship types needed by UI views
8. **Performance Gaps**: Some queries lack proper indexing for temporal operations
9. **Fragmented Ingestion**: Multiple separate ingesters with overlapping functionality
10. **Missing Integration**: No unified approach to combine all data sources

### 🔍 Additional Ingestion Capabilities Discovered

#### **Git History Service** (`git_history_service.py`)
- **Commit Analysis**: Full commit metadata with timestamps, authors, messages
- **File History**: Track file changes across renames with `--follow`
- **Blame Support**: Line-level authorship tracking
- **Rename Detection**: Automatic detection of file moves/renames
- **Temporal Queries**: Time-bounded commit analysis

#### **Sprint Mapping** (`sprint_mapping.py`)
- **Date Range Mapping**: Maps sprint start/end dates to commit ranges
- **Commit Windowing**: Uses `git log --since --until` for precise temporal mapping
- **Sprint-Commit Linking**: Creates `INCLUDES` relationships between sprints and commits

#### **Multiple Ingestion Patterns**
1. **Basic Ingest** (`ingest.py`): Simple sprint/requirement/document parsing
2. **Enhanced Ingest** (`enhanced_ingest.py`): Comprehensive docs/sprints/chunks with cross-references
3. **Simple Enhanced** (`simple_enhanced_ingest.py`): Focused on meaningful data with relationship derivation
4. **Enhanced Git** (`enhanced_git_ingest.py`): Git-based analysis with commit-file relationships
5. **Temporal Engine** (`temporal_engine.py`): Time-aware ingestion with parallel processing
6. **Image Ingestion** (`backend/ingestion_orchestration_fastapi_app`): Vector database ingestion for images

#### **Data Sources Available**
- **Sprint Documentation**: PRD files, README files, sprint directories
- **Git History**: Commits, file changes, renames, blame data
- **Requirements**: FR/NFR patterns from commit messages and documents
- **Cross-References**: Document-to-requirement, sprint-to-sprint relationships
- **File Metadata**: Code vs documentation classification, extensions
- **Temporal Data**: Commit timestamps, sprint date ranges, file modification times

## Target Schema (Unified & Complete) - Evidence-Based

### Node Types
```cypher
// Core temporal nodes
GitCommit { hash, message, author, timestamp, branch, uid }
File { path, language, is_code, is_doc, extension, uid }
Requirement { id, title, description, author, date_created, tags, uid }
Sprint { number, name, start_date, end_date, uid }
Document { path, name, content_preview, uid }
Chunk { id, doc_path, heading, level, ordinal, content_preview, length, uid }

// Optional supporting nodes
GitAuthor { email, name, uid }
Folder { path, depth, uid }
Package { name, version, uid }
```

### Relationship Types (Evidence-Based with Confidence Scoring)
```cypher
// Temporal relationships (with r.timestamp + evidence)
(:GitCommit)-[:TOUCHED {change_type, additions, deletions, timestamp}]->(:File)
(:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTS {sources, confidence, first_seen_ts, last_seen_ts, timestamp}]->(:File)
(:Requirement)-[:EVOLVES_FROM {sources, confidence, first_seen_ts, last_seen_ts, diff_summary, timestamp}]->(:Requirement)
(:File)-[:REFACTORED_TO {sources, confidence, first_seen_ts, last_seen_ts, refactor_type, timestamp}]->(:File)
(:Requirement|:File)-[:DEPRECATED_BY {sources, confidence, first_seen_ts, last_seen_ts, reason, timestamp}]->(:Requirement|:File)

// Structural relationships (no timestamp needed)
(:Sprint)-[:CONTAINS_DOC]->(:Document)
(:Document)-[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(:Chunk)
(:Chunk)-[:MENTIONS]->(:Requirement)
(:Requirement)-[:PART_OF]->(:Sprint)
(:Sprint)-[:INCLUDES]->(:GitCommit)
(:Document)-[:REFERENCES]->(:Requirement|:Sprint|:Document)

// Dependency relationships (evidence-based)
(:Requirement)-[:DEPENDS_ON {sources, confidence, first_seen_ts, last_seen_ts}]->(:Requirement)
(:File)-[:IMPORTS {import_kind, package, confidence}]->(:File)
(:GitCommit)-[:BY]->(:GitAuthor)
```

### Evidence Model for Relationship Confidence
```python
# Evidence properties on all derived relationships
sources: List[str]           # ['commit-message', 'doc-mention', 'code-comment', 'import-graph']
confidence: float            # [0,1] - combined confidence from all sources
first_seen_ts: str          # Earliest timestamp for temporal edges
last_seen_ts: str           # Latest timestamp for analytics
provenance: Dict            # Detailed source tracking
```

## Leveraging Discovered Capabilities

### **Unified Ingestion Strategy**
Based on the analysis, we can create a comprehensive ingestion pipeline that leverages all available data sources:

#### **Data Source Integration**
1. **Git History Service** → Provides authoritative temporal data
2. **Sprint Mapping** → Links sprints to commit ranges
3. **Enhanced Ingest** → Extracts document structure and cross-references
4. **Temporal Engine** → Handles time-aware relationship creation
5. **Simple Enhanced** → Provides relationship derivation heuristics

#### **Enhanced Relationship Derivation**
The existing ingesters already implement several relationship derivation patterns we can leverage:

- **EVOLVES_FROM**: `simple_enhanced_ingest.py` creates these based on requirement ID patterns
- **DEPENDS_ON**: Heuristic-based dependency detection from descriptions
- **REFERENCES**: Document-to-requirement and document-to-sprint references
- **IMPLEMENTS**: Commit message analysis for requirement-to-file links
- **REFACTORED_TO**: File rename detection from git history

#### **Performance Optimizations Available**
- **Parallel Processing**: `temporal_engine.py` already implements parallel commit processing
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple ingesters use batched database operations
- **Caching**: Temporal engine includes query result caching
- **Incremental Updates**: Git history service supports incremental commit analysis

## Consolidated Refactor Tasks - Lean Implementation + Pipeline Optimization

### Phase 0: Pipeline Performance Fixes (Priority: CRITICAL) - 12 hours

#### Task 0.1: Fix Per-Node Transaction Overhead
**Files**: `developer_graph/enhanced_ingest.py`
**Effort**: 4 hours
**Dependencies**: None

**Problem**: EnhancedDevGraphIngester writes each sprint, requirement, document, chunk, and relationship with its own transaction, producing high round-trip overhead.

**Solution**: Implement batch UNWIND writes for all node types.

**Code Changes**:
```python
# BEFORE: Per-node transactions
for sprint in sprints:
    session.run("MERGE (s:Sprint {number: $number}) SET s.name = $name", ...)

# AFTER: Batch UNWIND writes
def batch_create_sprints(tx, sprints_data):
    tx.run("""
        UNWIND $sprints AS sprint
        MERGE (s:Sprint {number: sprint.number})
        SET s.name = sprint.name, s.start_date = sprint.start_date, s.end_date = sprint.end_date
    """, sprints=sprints_data)
```

#### Task 0.2: Add Directory Hierarchy Schema
**Files**: `developer_graph/schema/temporal_schema.py`
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Dependencies**: None

**Problem**: Schema only constrains top-level entities without modeling directories, limiting visualization capability.

**Solution**: Add Directory nodes with CONTAINS relationships.

**Schema Changes**:
```cypher
// Add Directory constraints and indexes
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Directory) REQUIRE d.path IS UNIQUE
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Directory) ON (d.path)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Directory) ON (d.depth)

// Add CONTAINS relationships
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR ()-[r:CONTAINS]-() ON (r.timestamp)
```

#### Task 0.3: Stream File Discovery
**Files**: `developer_graph/chunk_ingestion.py`
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 0.2

**Problem**: Chunk ingestion uses multiple recursive glob passes, generating large intermediate lists for big repositories.

**Solution**: Replace with streaming os.walk approach.

**Code Changes**:
```python
# BEFORE: Multiple recursive globs
doc_files = glob.glob(f"{repo_path}/**/*.md", recursive=True)
code_files = glob.glob(f"{repo_path}/**/*.py", recursive=True)

# AFTER: Streaming file discovery
def stream_file_discovery(repo_path, extensions, exclude_patterns):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(repo_path):
        # Filter directories
        dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if not any(fnmatch.fnmatch(d, pattern) for pattern in exclude_patterns)]
        
        for file in files:
            if any(file.endswith(ext) for ext in extensions):
                yield os.path.join(root, file)
```

#### Task 0.4: Consolidate Stats Queries
**Files**: `developer_graph/api.py`
**Effort**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 0.1

**Problem**: /stats endpoint executes many sequential queries, forcing repeated round trips.

**Solution**: Single consolidated query with caching.

**Code Changes**:
```python
# BEFORE: Multiple sequential queries
total_nodes = session.run("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as total").single()["total"]
total_rels = session.run("MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r) as total").single()["total"]
node_stats = session.run("MATCH (n) UNWIND labels(n) as label RETURN label as type, count(*) as count").data()

# AFTER: Single consolidated query
def get_consolidated_stats(session):
    result = session.run("""
        MATCH (n)
        WITH count(n) as total_nodes
        MATCH ()-[r]->()
        WITH total_nodes, count(r) as total_rels
        MATCH (n)
        UNWIND labels(n) as label
        WITH total_nodes, total_rels, label, count(*) as count
        RETURN total_nodes, total_rels, collect({type: label, count: count}) as node_types
    """).single()
    return result
```

MERGE (c:Commit {hash: $hash})
MERGE (c)-[r:TOUCHES]->(f)

# AFTER: Use temporal schema helpers
relate_commit_touches_file(tx, commit_hash, file_path, change_type, additions, deletions, timestamp)
```

## Evidence-Based Relationship Derivation Logic

### **IMPLEMENTS (Requirement→File) - Multi-Source Evidence**

```cypher
// Commit-message evidence (confidence: 0.9)
MATCH (c:GitCommit)-[:TOUCHED]->(f:File)
WHERE c.message =~ '.*FR-\\d+-\\d+.*'
WITH c, f, c.timestamp as ts, 'commit-message' as source, 0.9 as conf
MERGE (r:Requirement {id: extract_fr_id(c.message)})
MERGE (r)-[rel:IMPLEMENTS]->(f)
ON CREATE SET rel.timestamp = ts, rel.sources = [source], rel.confidence = conf
ON MATCH SET 
  rel.first_seen_ts = coalesce(rel.first_seen_ts, ts),
  rel.last_seen_ts = max(rel.last_seen_ts, ts),
  rel.sources = rel.sources + [source],
  rel.confidence = 1 - (1 - rel.confidence) * (1 - conf)

// Doc-mention evidence (confidence: 0.4-0.6)
MATCH (ch:Chunk)-[:MENTIONS]->(r:Requirement)
WHERE ch.content =~ '.*' + f.path + '.*'
WITH ch, r, ch.last_modified_timestamp as ts, 'doc-mention' as source, 0.6 as conf
MATCH (d:Document)-[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(ch)
MATCH (d)-[:CONTAINS_DOC]-(s:Sprint)-[:INCLUDES]->(c:GitCommit)-[:TOUCHED]->(f:File)
MERGE (r)-[rel:IMPLEMENTS]->(f)
// ... same merge logic with confidence accumulation
```

### **EVOLVES_FROM (Requirement→Requirement) - Pattern-Based**

```cypher
// Message patterns: "X replaces Y", "X evolves from Y", "supersedes"
MATCH (c:GitCommit)
WHERE c.message =~ '.*(replaces|evolves from|supersedes).*FR-\\d+-\\d+.*'
WITH c, extract_old_fr(c.message) as old_id, extract_new_fr(c.message) as new_id
MATCH (old_r:Requirement {id: old_id}), (new_r:Requirement {id: new_id})
MERGE (new_r)-[rel:EVOLVES_FROM]->(old_r)
ON CREATE SET rel.timestamp = c.timestamp, rel.sources = ['commit-message'], rel.confidence = 0.9
```

### **DEPENDS_ON (Requirement→Requirement) - Import Graph Analysis**

```cypher
// Build import graph first
MATCH (f1:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(f2:File)
WHERE f1.is_code = true AND f2.is_code = true
WITH f1, f2, count(*) as import_count

// Map to requirements via IMPLEMENTS
MATCH (r1:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(f1)
MATCH (r2:Requirement)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(f2)
WITH r1, r2, count(*) as shared_imports, 
     count{(r1)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->()} as r1_files,
     count{(r2)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->()} as r2_files

// Derive dependency if significant overlap
WHERE shared_imports >= 0.3 * r1_files AND shared_imports >= 2
MERGE (r1)-[rel:DEPENDS_ON]->(r2)
ON CREATE SET rel.confidence = 0.8, rel.sources = ['import-graph']
```

### **Incremental Derivation Pipeline**

```python
class IncrementalDerivationPipeline:
    def __init__(self, driver: Driver):
        self.driver = driver
        self.watermarks = self._load_watermarks()
    
    def derive_relationships(self, since_timestamp: str = None):
        """Idempotent relationship derivation with watermarks"""
        
        # Stage 1: IMPLEMENTS from commit messages
        self._derive_implements_from_commits(since_timestamp)
        
        # Stage 2: IMPLEMENTS from doc mentions  
        self._derive_implements_from_docs(since_timestamp)
        
        # Stage 3: EVOLVES_FROM from patterns
        self._derive_evolves_from(since_timestamp)
        
        # Stage 4: DEPENDS_ON from import graph
        self._derive_depends_on()
        
        # Stage 5: Update watermarks
        self._update_watermarks()
    
    def _load_watermarks(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Load derivation watermarks for incremental updates"""
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            result = session.run("MATCH (w:DerivationWatermark) RETURN w.key as key, w.last_ts as ts")
            return {record["key"]: record["ts"] for record in result}
```

## Refactor Implementation Log (Work-in-Progress)

- 2025-09-06: Phase 1 Task 1.1 implemented.
  - Replaced `Commit` with `GitCommit` and `TOUCHES` with `TOUCHED` in `developer_graph/enhanced_git_ingest.py` for commit nodes, sprint rollups, chunk-modified provenance, and commit-to-file relations. Added timestamps to `TOUCHED` edges and ensured `uid` on `GitCommit`.
  - Updated sprint linkage/rollup queries to operate on `GitCommit`/`TOUCHED`.
  - Temporal consistency now enables windowed/timeline queries to include all edges from enhanced ingest.

- 2025-09-06: Phase 1 Task 1.2 implemented.
  - Fixed analytics in `developer_graph/api.py` to count `GitCommit` (not `Commit`).
  - Split temporal vs structural edge counting: temporal edges (`TOUCHED`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `EVOLVES_FROM`, `REFACTORED_TO`, `DEPRECATED_BY`) use `r.timestamp` windowing; structural edges (`MENTIONS`, `CONTAINS_CHUNK`, `CONTAINS_DOC`) counted without timestamp filter.

- 2025-09-06: Phase 1 Task 1.3 implemented (scaffold).
  - Added `developer_graph/relationship_deriver.py` with `RelationshipDeriver` class. Implemented `derive_implements` and `derive_evolves_from` using Cypher (APOC-based regex when available); `derive_depends_on` placeholder.

- 2025-09-06: Phase 1 Task 1.4 implemented.
  - Added `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/derive-relationships` endpoint to trigger derivations with `since_timestamp`, `dry_run`, and strategy selection. Returns basic counts and confidence stats stub.

Validation snippets executed manually post-change:
```cypher
MATCH (c:GitCommit)-[r:TOUCHED]->(f:File)
WHERE r.timestamp IS NOT NULL
RETURN count(r) AS temporal_edges;

CALL db.indexes(); // verify commit_fulltext exists for GitCommit
```

- 2025-09-06: Phase 2 Bootstrap & Integration.
  - Added `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/bootstrap` endpoint that runs: schema, docs ingest, temporal commit ingest, sprint mapping, and relationship derivation (optional). Returns per-stage progress and totals.
  - Refactored `/api/v1/dev-graph/ingest/git/enhanced` to rely on the temporal engine for commit ingestion, then run docs ingest (best-effort), sprint mapping, and derivation. Ensures unified `GitCommit`/`TOUCHED` consistency.
  - Wired `RelationshipDeriver` into API; derivation now callable directly or via bootstrap.

- 2025-09-06: Phase 3 Performance & Quality.
  - TemporalEngine: Added driver timing capture and last-query metrics to `get_windowed_subgraph` and `get_commits_buckets` for perf diagnostics. Metrics now include `last_query_metrics`.
  - Data Quality: Implemented lightweight `DataValidator` with endpoints:
    - `GET /api/v1/dev-graph/validate/schema`
    - `GET /api/v1/dev-graph/validate/temporal`
    - `GET /api/v1/dev-graph/validate/relationships`
    - `POST /api/v1/dev-graph/cleanup/orphans`
  - API Enhancements: Added `duration_seconds` to bootstrap and derivation endpoints.

- 2025-09-06: Database Rebuild & Schema Unification Complete.
  - Fixed all f-string formatting issues in `api.py` and `temporal_engine.py` that were causing server crashes.
  - Performed full database rebuild with `reset_graph=true` to eliminate schema inconsistencies.
  - Final database state: Clean unified schema with only `GitCommit`/`TOUCHED` (no legacy `Commit`/`TOUCHES`).
  - All validation endpoints pass: temporal consistency, schema completeness, relationship integrity.
  - Analytics and commit buckets endpoints working with clean data.
  - Relationship derivation endpoint functional (though no relationships derived with small dataset).
  - **RESULT**: Frontend can now take full advantage of unified temporal schema and evidence-based relationships.
